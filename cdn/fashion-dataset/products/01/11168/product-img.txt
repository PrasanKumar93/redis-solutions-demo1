2. **Design and Features**: The shirt is dark maroon, a color commonly associated with professionalism and sophistication, making it suitable for formal environments. It has a full-length buttoned placket at the front, providing a classic and clean look.

4. **Wash Care**: The care instructions indicate machine or hand wash at 40°C, with a recommendation to wash dark colors separately to avoid color bleeding.
