It features a graphic print on the front, consisting of what appears to be a motocross biker in action, accompanied by textual elements that reference a biker theme. The number "47" is prominently displayed on the graphic, which could be a stylistic choice or a reference to a specific biker or event.

Customers are advised to hand wash the item in cold water using a mild detergent, wash dark colors separately, avoid bleaching and wringing, not tumble dry, and flat dry it in the shade. For ironing, a mild iron is recommended, and direct ironing on the print/embellishments/embroidery should be avoided to prevent damage.

To complement the t-shirt's casual and sporty look, it is suggested to pair it with jeans and sports shoes or cotton shorts and leather sandals. This kind of pairing would enhance the t-shirt's appeal and match well with the biker-inspired aesthetic.
