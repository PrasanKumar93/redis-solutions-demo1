From the image and product details provided, this Puma watch has a design that balances sporty functionality with a touch of femininity. Its key attributes include:

1. Appearance: The watch features a rectangle dial, which is a departure from the more common circular designs, giving it a modern look. The case diameter is 27 mm, which is a moderate size for a feminine watch, making it noticeable without being overly large or bulky.

2. Material and Design: The watch's case is made of stainless steel, contributing to its durability and premium feel. The heavy-duty design is softened by a crystal-encrusted bezel, adding a touch of elegance and sparkle, making it suitable for both casual and dressier occasions.

3. Strap: The strap appears to be made of synthetic material, with a pink color and a textured pattern. The tang clasp is a standard closure for watches, providing security and ease of use.

4. Dial: The black dial houses three time displays, allowing the wearer to track time more precisely with additional counters, presumably for stopwatch functions. The presence of the jumping cat logo identifies it as a Puma product, emphasizing the brandâ€™s sporty image.

5. Time-Setting: A screw is mentioned for resetting time, which might refer to the crown of the watch typically used to adjust time and date settings.

6. Date Function: The date aperture located at the 3-hour mark is a useful feature for keeping track of the date.

7. Durability: A solid stainless steel case back will likely stand up well to wear and tear, and contributes to the watch's 50-metre water resistance capability. This means it should withstand splashes, brief immersion in water, and possibly swimming, though it might not be suited for diving or high-impact water sports.

8. Warranty: The watch comes with a two-year warranty, suggesting confidence in its quality and durability.

In summary, the product is positioned as a versatile accessory suitable for a modern, active lifestyle. It combines fashion elements, such as the encrusted bezel and pink strap, with functional aspects, like multiple time displays and water resistance. The watch appears to be well-designed for those who appreciate a blend of sportiness, practicality, and a touch of glamour.
