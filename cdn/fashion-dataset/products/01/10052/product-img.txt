The image shows a pair of black swimming trunks consistent with the description provided. The trunks have a slim fit profile and feature a white stripe running down the sides, which visually elongates the look of the legs and adds to the style. The elasticated waistband is not visible from the outside, indicating comfort and a clean appearance. White drawstrings are mentioned but are not visible in the image—they are likely on the inside for an adjustable fit. The brand logo appears to be embossed on the left thigh area, which offers a subtle brand identification.

The material composition of 80% nylon and 20% elastane for the shell makes the trunks stretchable and form-fitting, which could enhance swimming performance through reduced drag. The elasticity provided by the elastane allows for ease of movement, which is crucial for swimwear. The use of 100% polyester for the lining ensures a soft touch against the skin while also contributing to the trunks' durability and quick-drying properties.

The wash care instructions suggest that the trunks require gentle care, with machine washing in cool water without bleaching, tumble drying, ironing, or dry cleaning. Following these instructions is important to maintain the trunks’ integrity and appearance.

The product description promises comfort and efficiency in drying, which is beneficial for swimmers who might engage in frequent sessions in the water. The mention of the model's statistics (height and waist) and the trouser length provides additional context for potential buyers to estimate the fit of the trunks on their own bodies.

Overall, the image aligns with the product details, showcasing a pair of swimming trunks designed for performance and comfort, with a focus on a sleek design and quick-drying capabilities. The branding is minimalist, and the inclusion of functional elements like the internal drawstring provides practical value.
