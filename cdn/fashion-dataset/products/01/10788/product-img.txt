Description of the Shirt as Seen in the Image:

1. **Nehru Collar**: The shirt has a distinctive Nehru collar, which is a stand-up collar commonly found on Indian garments. This gives the shirt a slightly more formal and distinctive look compared to traditional spread or point collars.

2. **Full Front Button Placket**: It has a standard full-length button placket at the front, which is a common feature for standard button-up shirts. It allows for flexibility in how open or closed the shirt is worn.

3. **Short Sleeves with Brand Appliqué**: The shirt has short sleeves, making it appropriate for casual or semi-formal occasions in warmer weather. There is a visible brand appliqué on the right sleeve, which is a detail that sometimes resonates well with brand-conscious consumers.

4. **Buttoned Flap Pockets**: There are two chest pockets with buttoned flaps, contributing to the utility and style of the shirt. Embroidered branding is noticeable on the left pocket, adding a subtle branded element without being overly conspicuous.

5. **Curved Hemline**: The hem of the shirt is curved, which is a common feature that allows the shirt to look more natural and flattering when left untucked. It adds to the versatility of the shirt, suiting both tucked and untucked styles.

6. **Color and Pattern**: The color combination of cream, navy blue, and maroon in a check pattern offers a balanced look that could be versatile for pairing with different types of jeans, chinos, or shorts.
