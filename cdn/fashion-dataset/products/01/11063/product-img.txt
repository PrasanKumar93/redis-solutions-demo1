**Design and Features:**
- The shirt features a full-length buttoned placket which is standard for a formal shirt.
- The presence of a patch pocket on the left chest offers a classic element to the shirt's design.
- A slightly curved hemline suggests that the shirt can be worn tucked or untucked, though the formal style is traditionally worn tucked in.

**Fit and Size:**
- The regular fit described suggests the shirt is not too tight or too loose, aiming to accommodate a wide range of body types comfortably.
- According to the model statistics, the model is wearing size M which would typically indicate a chest size of around 38-40 inches for most brands, but this can vary.
