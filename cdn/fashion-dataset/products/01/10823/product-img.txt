The product in the image is a grey and green striped polo neck t-shirt. As per the provided details, the t-shirt is made of 100% cotton which suggests it is likely to be comfortable and breathable, suitable for casual wear or possibly for light sports activities given its polo style.

Let's break down the details provided and relate them to the image:

1. Color and Design: The image shows the grey and green striped pattern clearly, with horizontal stripes of equal width. The colors are vibrant and the stripes are consistent throughout the t-shirt, which translates into a visually appealing design.

2. Sleeves: The t-shirt has short sleeves with ribbed hems, as mentioned in the product details. The ribbing can be observed at the end of the sleeves, providing elasticity and maintaining shape which can contribute to the durability and fit.

3. Branding: There's branding printed on the left sleeve, which appears to be a white emblem or logo, although the specific design details are not clear. This type of branding is often used as a subtle design element and to indicate the t-shirt's brand identity.

4. Collar and Placket: There is a ribbed and tipped collar, meaning the collar has a finer rib detail and probably a contrasting color trim at its edge. The buttoned chest placket that's mentioned in the details can be seen holding two buttons, which is typical for polo shirts, allowing for adjustable neck comfort.

5. Vented Hem: Although not fully visible in the image, the vented hem is suggested by the slightly visible hemline, which typically means there are small slits on the side of the t-shirt at the hip level, allowing for greater movement flexibility and a more relaxed fit.

6. Appliquéd Branding: On the left chest is the appliquéd branding as described in the product details. The logo or emblem is prominent, having a contrasting color that stands out against the striped pattern.

7. Fit and Style: The t-shirt is worn by a male model who displays how the garment fits on the body. The fit appears to be relatively snug but not tight, suggesting a standard or slim fit design. The model is also wearing it with denim jeans, indicating how it can be styled as casual wear.

Overall, the product seems to be a classic polo t-shirt, which could be suitable for everyday use or casual occasions, with special attention to branding elements for those who appreciate or are loyal to the brand. The cotton material promises comfort for the wearer, and the design is both youthful and sporty. The combination of grey and green offers a versatile look that could easily pair with various colors of pants or shorts.
