Based on the provided product details and the image, the product in question is a black polo neck t-shirt. Below is a comprehensive analysis of the product:

1. **Composition**:
   - The t-shirt is made of 100% cotton, which usually offers breathability and comfort.
   - It features a ribbed and tipped collar with a white lining, which adds to the aesthetic appeal of the t-shirt with a touch of contrast.
   - The short sleeves have ribbed hems with white lining, which complements the collar design and ensures a snug fit at the edges.
   - There is a grey inseam detail providing subtle color variation and style.
   - An embroidered branding on the left chest is visible, which is common with designer or brand-name t-shirts for brand recognition.
   - There is also a buttoned chest placket that adds a classic polo t-shirt feature.

2. **Fitting**:
   - The description states that the fit of the t-shirt is regular, which suggests it is designed to fit comfortably on the body without being too tight or too loose.

3. **Wash Care**:
   - The t-shirt requires machine washing separately in cold water with a mild detergent, which is standard for preserving the quality of cotton fabrics.
   - It is recommended not to bleach the t-shirt, as bleach can damage the color and fiber.
   - Soaking should be avoided, presumably to prevent color leaching or material degradation.
   - The garment should be line-dried inside out in the shade, which helps prevent color fading from direct sunlight.
   - A warm iron can be used, but ironing directly on print/embroidery should be avoided to prevent damage.

4. **Styling Suggestions**:
   - The description suggests that the t-shirt can be flaunted for a sporty look due to its brand statement and comfort, making it suitable for sportswear.
   - It is also recommended for a casual look when paired with jeans and semi-formal shoes. This versatility is one of the classic benefits of polo t-shirts.
