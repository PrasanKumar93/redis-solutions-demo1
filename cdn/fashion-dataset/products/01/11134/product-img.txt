This Puma watch features a distinctive asymmetric octagonal dial with a rugged appearance, making it suitable for a person with an active lifestyle or those seeking a watch with a bold look. The case diameter measures 40 mm, which is a common size that suits a wide range of wrist sizes, while the case thickness is 10 mm, indicating a solid build without being excessively bulky.

The metal case, together with the fixed bezel, provides durability and a certain level of sophistication. The black textured polyurethane (PU) strap with a buckle clasp combines comfort with a sporty appeal and ensures that the watch can handle day-to-day wear and tear.

The design of the dial reinforces the watch's robust character, featuring a black background with the Puma cat logo positioned below the 12 o'clock mark, contributing to the watch's branded aesthetic. Bold numerals mark the hours, enhancing readability. The analog dial shows the time with hour, minute, and second hands, which is a traditional time-telling method preferred by many for its simplicity.

A date aperture located at the 3 o'clock position adds functionality, providing a quick reference for the date. The red second hand provides a striking contrast against the black dial, which not only adds to the visual appeal but also improves visibility.

The watch's quartz movement is a reliable and accurate timekeeping mechanism, requiring minimal maintenance other than battery changes. The solid case back made of stainless steel enhances the durability of the watch and contributes to its water resistance capability, which is rated up to 50 metres. This level of water resistance makes the watch suitable for everyday use and capable of withstanding brief immersion in water, such as when washing hands or in the rain.

Overall, this Puma watch seems to offer a good balance of style, functionality, and durability. It appears to be designed for those who prefer a timepiece that can withstand active use while retaining a certain level of stylish toughness. The two-year warranty provided with the watch offers additional peace of mind regarding the quality and after-sales support.
