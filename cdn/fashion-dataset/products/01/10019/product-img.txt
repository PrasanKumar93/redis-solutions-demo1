The product depicted in the image is a white t-shirt designed for running, with significant features specified in the accompanying product details.

Composition:
- The t-shirt is made from 100% polyester, a material known for its durability and resistance to wrinkles and shrinking.
- Engineered with Dri-Fit fabric technology, it is expected to offer moisture-wicking properties, drawing sweat away from the body to keep the wearer dry and comfortable during exercise.
- The t-shirt includes a mesh crew-neck and side panels, which are likely to provide added breathability, allowing air flow to cool the body.
- A reflective loop at the upper back is mentioned, a feature that can be used for threading media player cords to prevent them from getting in the way during physical activity. It also has the added benefit of increasing visibility during low-light conditions.
- Flat seams are designed to minimize irritation or chafing against the skin.

Fitting:
- The product is described as having a slim fit, which suggests it conforms closely to the body's shape, providing a sleek profile without excess fabric that could interfere with movement.

Wash Care:
- The wash care instructions recommend machine washing cold at 30 degrees with like colours to preserve the fabric's quality and prevent colour bleeding.
- Users are advised not to bleach, which could damage the material or alter the colouring.
- Tumble drying should be done on a low setting, and the garment should be removed immediately to avoid wrinkles or potential damage from heat.
- Cool iron is permissible, but direct ironing on the designed areas is to be avoided to prevent damage to any printed graphics or logos.
- It is also advised not to dry clean the shirt.
