The image is that of a classic analog wristwatch by the brand Esprit. Based on the product details provided and the image, here's a comprehensive analysis:

Design and Features:
- The watch has a round dial shape which is a timeless design and popular among classic watch styles.
- It boasts a metallic case with a fixed bezel, which provides durability and adds to the watch's style. The bezel has tachymeter markings, which is a feature used to measure speed based on travel time or measure distance based on speed.
- The strap is made of leather and includes a tang clasp that offers a secure fit and a traditional buckle-style look.
- The black dial features illuminator strips on the hour markings which enhance readability in low light conditions. There is also a date aperture between the 4 and 5 o’clock position, a common feature for quick date reference.
- The watch includes mini dials—these are likely subdials indicating hours, minutes, and seconds in a chronograph function, providing more precise time measurement capabilities.
- The back of the case is solid stainless steel, known for its robustness and durability, and often used in watchmaking due to its resistance to corrosion and staining.

Mechanism:
- The watch uses quartz movement for displaying time. Quartz movements are known for their accuracy and require minimal maintenance besides battery changes.
- A screw is present to reset the time and date. This would typically be the crown of the watch, which can be pulled out and turned to adjust the watch's settings.

Specifications:
- The case diameter is 40mm, which is a common and versatile size suitable for a wide range of wrist sizes. It's large enough to be easily readable without being overly bulky.
- The case thickness is 10mm, striking a balance between a substantial feel and comfort without being too heavy or thick on the wrist.
- The water resistance is noted as being suitable for swimming, with a specification “10 BAR,” which equates to being water resistant up to 100 meters or 330 feet. This level of water resistance is generally sufficient for swimming and snorkeling but not high-impact water sports or diving.

Overall, the watch combines traditional design elements with modern features that appeal to those looking for a versatile and functional watch with a stylish edge. The presence of a tachymeter, water resistance, and chronograph subdials reflects a focus on utility as well as design, making it suitable for both casual and formal occasions. The classic color scheme with a black dial and contrasting white markings ensures it will complement most outfits, suggesting that the watch is positioned as a fashionable, yet utilitarian accessory.
