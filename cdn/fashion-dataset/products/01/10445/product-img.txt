The product depicted in the image is a pair of blue stone wash denim trousers. The following is a comprehensive analysis based on the product details provided and the image observed:

Composition:
- The jeans have a blue stone wash finish, giving them a slightly faded and lived-in look, which is characteristic of this style.
- The trousers feature detailing such as two front pockets with brand embroidery above the left pocket. There is also a patch pocket above the right pocket, which provides additional space and an element of style.
- At the back, there are two large pockets with stitch detailing. Notably, a patch pocket is integrated into the left back pocket, which could be an interesting design feature or for added functionality.
- The waist is described as comfortable, with loops for a belt, and there's a brand badge on the right side at the back, which is a common place for branding on denim.
- For the closure system, the jeans have a zipper and button.
- Reinforced stitch detailing in the crotch and waist enhances durability, which is especially important in these areas that experience a lot of movement and potential stress.

Fitting:
- The fit is described as "Slim boot," which suggests the jeans are designed to be fitted through the thigh and knee but have a slight flare or wider opening at the hem to accommodate boots.

Wash Care:
- To maintain the quality and appearance of the denim, it is recommended to wash and dry the jeans separately.
- The denim should be washed inside out in a mild detergent, which helps preserve the color and reduce the appearance of fading.
- The jeans should not be bleached, which would alter the color and potentially damage the fabric.
- Drying under shade rather than in direct sunlight can prevent potential color fading and fabric warping.

Styling Recommendation:
- These denim trousers are marketed as perfect for casual outings with friends, and the suggestion is to pair them with grunge tees, leather vests, and leather boots to create an edgy look.

Model Statistics:
- The model in the image is wearing jeans with a length of 42 inches.
- The model's dimensions include a height of 6 feet and a waist of 32 inches.

Analysis of Image:
- The image shows the jeans worn by a model that represents the target body type for the intended fit. The jeans appear to sit well on the hips, and the slim boot cut is observable, with the jeans fitting closely down to the knee and then slightly widening toward the hem.
- The front view demonstrates the placement of the pockets and the brand embroidery, although the patch pocket on the back and the brand badge are not visible from this angle.
- The image is likely intended to showcase the fit and style of the jeans while also demonstrating how they could be worn with casual footwear (boat shoes in this case).
