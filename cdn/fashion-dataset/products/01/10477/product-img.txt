The product depicted in the image is a men's long-sleeved plaid shirt featuring a blue and red check pattern with light blue accents. The shirt is made from 100% cotton, which promises durability and breathable comfort. The regular fit is designed to accommodate the needs of various body types, ensuring a comfortable fit without being too tight or too loose.

The details of the shirt include a buttoned placket that runs down the chest, further enhancing the classic look of the shirt. There are two patch pockets on the chest, each with buttoned closures, which are both functional and add to the shirt's visual appeal. The embroidered brand logo is located over the left chest pocket, providing a subtle nod to the brand and giving the shirt a touch of exclusivity.

The hemline of the shirt is curved, which is a traditional finish for casual shirts as it can be worn untucked while still maintaining a polished look. Curved hemlines also provide a bit more coverage in the back, which is preferred by many for comfort and style.

For maintenance, the shirt requires machine washing in cold water, which is beneficial for preserving the fabric's color and preventing shrinkage. The instruction to avoid tumble drying and to turn the shirt inside out before drying helps maintain the integrity of the fabric, and ensures any print on the garment doesn't get damaged. The precautions about not drying in direct sunlight and using a warm iron are typical care instructions for cotton garments to prevent color fading and fabric damage.

The model in the image wears a size M and has a height of 6 feet with a shoulder width of 19 inches, which provides potential buyers with a reference for how the shirt might fit on a similar body type.

Overall, the shirt's design is modern and stylish, suitable for casual outings. The product description suggests pairing it with jeans or chinos and slip-on shoes for a relaxed yet fashionable look. The check pattern is timeless and versatile, making it a viable addition to any casual wardrobe. The image presents the shirt worn by a male model in a way that clearly showcases the product's features and fit.
