Based on the provided product details and the image, the product is an Esprit Axis analog wristwatch that combines traditional design elements with a modern aesthetic. Here's a detailed analysis of the watch:

**Design and Aesthetics:**
- The watch has a classic and contemporary look, which is versatile and likely appealing to a wide range of consumers.
- The white dial features numbered hour markings, which are clear and bold, making the time easy to read. The typeface used for the numbers is modern, with a clean, sans-serif style.
- There is a date and day socket located near the 3 o'clock marking, adding functionality to the watch.
- The watch has a round dial shape, a common and traditionally popular style.
- The case appears to be made from stainless steel with a fixed bezel, which contributes to both the watch's durability and its stylish appearance.

**Functionality and Features:**
- The watch uses quartz movement for time display, which is known for accuracy and low maintenance.
- A mineral crystal glass covers the watch face, which is durable and scratch-resistant. This type of glass is commonly used in watchmaking because it provides a good balance between protection and cost.
- Thereâ€™s a crown (referred to as a "screw" in the product details) on the side of the watch that is used for setting time, day, and date. The crown has a textured edge, likely making it easier to grip and adjust the settings.

**Build Quality and Comfort:**
- The leather strap with a tang clasp is a traditional choice that suggests comfort and durability. The black strap contrasts well with the stainless steel case and white dial, highlighting the watch's design.
- The solid case back mentioned in the product details implies the watch has a sealed rear part, which often aids in water resistance and structural integrity.
- The watch has a water-resistant feature, making it functional for everyday use where it may come into contact with moisture, like handwashing or rain.

**Dimensions:**
- The case diameter is 45 mm, which is relatively large, making a statement on the wrist and suiting current trends for larger watches.
- The case thickness is 11 mm, which indicates that the watch may have a substantial profile on the wrist, contributing to its presence and masculine appeal.
