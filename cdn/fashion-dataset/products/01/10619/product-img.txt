The footbed appears to be a dark color, possibly brown or black, which contrasts with the bright strap.

- **Design and Style:**
  The thong style strap is a classic design for slip-on sandals, providing a minimalistic yet functional approach to securing the foot in place. The presence of a toe separator is typical for this type of sandal, ensuring the wearer's foot is guided comfortably. This particular design is often chosen for its ease of wear and simplicity, suitable for casual outings or as a fashionable accessory in a relaxed setting.

- **Footbed:**
