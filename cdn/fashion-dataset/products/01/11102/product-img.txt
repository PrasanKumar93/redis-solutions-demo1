The image shows a male model wearing a white full-sleeved shirt with blue stripes. It's consistent with the product details which describe the shirt as having 70% polyester and 30% cotton composition. The shirt appears to be well-fitted on the model, aligning with the description of a "regular" fit.

Key features visible in the image are:

- Full-length buttoned placket, which is standard for formal shirts.
- A patch pocket on the left chest, which is a common feature in men's dress shirts. 
- The shirt's stripes are vertical, which can have a slimming effect and tend to be flattering on various body types.
- The collar of the shirt is stiff and well-shaped, suggesting a formal style appropriate for an office or business setting.
- Shirt cuffs are not visible in the image, but given the formal style, they would likely be buttoned.

The care instructions in the product details indicate that the shirt should be machine or hand-washed in cold water with mild detergent, and dark colours should be washed separately. These are typical recommendations for clothing that may bleed colour or is sensitive to heat. Not bleaching and tumble drying at low temperature would help in maintaining the fabric's integrity and color. Drying in shade and using a warm iron also suggest that the shirt should be handled with care to keep it looking crisp.

The product description suggests pairing the shirt with formal trousers and leather shoes, which would complement the shirt's professional look, making it appropriate for office wear. The suggestion to make weekdays fun with such a shirt implies it strikes a balance between formal and stylish.

The model statistics mention that he wears size 40 in shirts, is 6 feet tall, and has 18-inch shoulders, which can help potential buyers gauge how the shirt might fit on a person with a similar build.

Overall, the product seems to be positioned as a stylish yet formal piece of office wear, designed to provide comfort through its material blend and to maintain a crisp appearance throughout the day.
