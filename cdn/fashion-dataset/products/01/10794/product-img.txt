The image displays a male model showcasing a red, black, and white checkered shirt. However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the product description and the imageâ€”the product description mentions a "red, black and white check shirt," while the shirt in the image appears to have a blue and white check pattern. Therefore, it's important to confirm the actual colors of the product in question. The shirt features a full front button placket, a classic tipped collar, and full sleeves with a mid-sleeve buttoned flap, suggesting that the sleeves can be converted to a shorter length for a more casual look.

The shirt also includes buttoned flap pockets on each chest, providing a functional aspect as well as adding to the design. While we can't see the back chest from the image provided, the product description mentions embroidered branding in that area, which presumably adds a subtle branded detail to the shirt. The shirt also has stitch detailing, which may contribute to its overall aesthetic and durability. The curved hemline is a common design element that allows for a more flattering fit when the shirt is worn untucked.

As for fitting, the shirt is described as "comfort," which likely means it's designed to be roomy and comfortable without being overly loose or baggy, providing a good balance between fit and ease of movement.

With regard to care instructions, the shirt is made of 100% cotton, which is known for comfort and breathability. The included wash care advice is typical for cotton garments to maintain their color and integrity: hand wash in cold water with a mild detergent, wash dark colors separately, avoid bleach and tumble drying, flat dry in shade, and iron mildly while taking care to avoid any print or embroidery.

The styling suggestion in the product description recommends pairing the shirt with jeans and sports shoes for a semi-formal look, aligning with the casual and versatile style of the shirt as modeled. The model is said to wear a size M and is 6 feet tall with 18-inch shoulders; this provides a reference for the size and fit of the shirt as it appears in the image.

The discrepancy in color noted between the description and image needs to be accounted for in any listings or sales information to prevent customer confusion.
