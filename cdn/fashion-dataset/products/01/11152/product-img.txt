The image depicts a necktie with a checkered pattern primarily in black and white, with prominent orange accents for a pop of color. The checkered pattern consists of both broad and narrow checks, giving the tie a modern and somewhat bold aesthetic that could easily complement a variety of shirt colors – particularly white, black, and grey, as mentioned in the product details.

The tie is displayed rolled at the top (probably to showcase the pattern and how it would look when worn), with the remainder of the tie hanging straight down. One end of the tie is shown, but the specific cut (whether it’s a traditional cut or a modern narrow cut) isn’t visible due to the rolled upper portion. The rolled section also obscures the loop with the brand badge, but the product details mention its presence on the inner side.

It measures 153 cm in length, which is a common length for men’s ties, making it suitable for a wide range of body types and heights. The fabric is described as 100% handmade microfibre, which suggests the tie aims to provide a balance of durability and ease of use, as microfibre is known to be resilient and less prone to wrinkles compared to silk ties.

The product care instructions are succinct – only dry cleaning is recommended, which requires some level of maintenance commitment from the buyer. This indicates that the material may not fare well with typical at-home washing methods, which prospective buyers would need to consider.

Overall, the design, length, and specific care instructions point to a product that's ideal for customers looking for a contemporary and vibrant accessory that makes a statement when paired with more subdued attire, while also taking note of the maintenance required to preserve its quality and appearance.
