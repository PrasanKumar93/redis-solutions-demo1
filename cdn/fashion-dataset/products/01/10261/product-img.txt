The image provided shows a pair of men's formal trousers. Based on the product details, here is the analysis:

**Composition:**
- The trousers are a blend of 65% polyester and 35% cotton, which indicates they may have a balance between durability and breathability. Polyester can contribute to the strength and wrinkle resistance of the trousers, while cotton can provide a softer feel and increase comfort.

**Design:**
- The trousers feature a brown color with dark brown pin stripes. The pin stripe design is traditionally considered to be professional and can elongate the appearance of the legs, giving a slimming effect.
- There are two side pockets, a common feature in men's trousers, useful for carrying small items.
- The trousers have a flat front design, which is a modern look preferred by many for its clean lines and simplicity.
- They include a buttoned welt pocket on the right hip, which is a classic element in men's formal wear and useful for carrying small items like a wallet or key.
- The brand name is embroidered beside the right pocket, a detail that adds a touch of branding without being overtly conspicuous.
- The closure system consists of a metal zipper and a button, which is a standard closure for men's trousers.

**Wash Care:**
- The trousers are machine washable inside-out in warm water, which indicates ease of care, although customers need to segregate colors to avoid color transfer.
- They should not be bleached, tumble dried on a low setting, dried inside out in shade, and ironed with warm iron. Following these instructions can help maintain the trousers' appearance and longevity.
