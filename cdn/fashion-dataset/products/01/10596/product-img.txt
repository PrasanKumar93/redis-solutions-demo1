The product in the image is a vibrant green analog wristwatch from the brand Esprit, designed as part of their Houston collection. The watch features a modern, fashionable aesthetic while retaining elements of traditional design, potentially appealing to those who prefer contemporary accessories with timeless appeal.

The case of the watch is rectangular in shape, which is a nod to classic watch design but is less common than the typical round dials, giving it a unique look. It has a case diameter of 22 mm and a thickness of 9 mm, dimensions that suggest a relatively petite and sleek profile, which might appeal to those who favor subtler wristwatches.

The case and the strap are made of plastic, which may offer durability and comfort. The bezel of the watch has crystal embellishments, which adds a decorative and perhaps feminine touch to the design. This could make the watch suitable for casual wear or even certain dressy occasions where a bold statement piece is desired.

The strap is equipped with a fancy clasp, although the details of the clasp mechanism are not specified in the provided information. The green color of the dial and strap is consistent and bold, and the brand name is prominently displayed across the dial between the 7 and 11 o'clock markers in a silver font, which adds a contrasting design element and emphasizes brand identity. The time is indicated by simplistic silver-tone hands, and there's no mention of hour markers, which could suggest a minimalist aesthetic or a potentially challenging reading of time at a glance.

The watch is powered by a Miyota quartz movement, considered to be reliable and accurate, which is a notable feature for those who prioritize precision in timekeeping. It also has a screw to reset the time, and water resistance up to 30 meters. This level of water resistance does not make the watch suitable for swimming or diving, but it should withstand splashes, hand-washing, and light rain, thus offering practical durability for everyday use.

Overall, the Esprit Houston analog wristwatch appears to be a fashionable timepiece that combines trendy design with practical features. Its bold color and embellishments might attract a specific customer base interested in watches that stand out and serve as an accessory rather than just a functional item. However, the plastic material might influence perceptions of quality and durability depending on the consumer's preferences. The water resistance feature adds practicality to what seems primarily a style-oriented timepiece.
