The product details provided suggest that the bag would require regular care to maintain its appearance. The recommendation to rub the surface with a dry clean cloth to remove dust and dirt is a standard instruction for leather products, which helps to prevent the buildup of grime that can damage the material over time.

The care instructions hint at a desire to keep the bag in good condition for as long as possible, which is typical advice for maintaining the quality of leather goods.
