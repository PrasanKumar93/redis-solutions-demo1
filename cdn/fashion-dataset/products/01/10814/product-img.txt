The product displayed is a purple and white checkered shirt. This shirt is constructed from 100% cotton material, known for its breathability and comfort, especially in warmer climates.

Looking closely at the design, the shirt features a tipped collar, providing a subtle detail that distinguishes it from a standard collar. The front of the shirt has a full button placket which is a classic feature in such garments. The sleeves are short, making this shirt suitable for casual wear or for semi-formal settings in warm weather.

The shirt is equipped with two chest pockets, each secured with a buttoned flap. The left pocket bears a brand badge which adds to the brand identity and is indicative of its manufacturer's heritage. This particular type of pocket is both functional and adds an element of style to the shirt. The presence of stitch detailing likely contributes to the shirt's overall durability and aesthetic appeal, while the curved hemline provides a modern look which allows the shirt to be worn untucked without compromising the outfit's neatness.

In terms of care, the shirt requires hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent, and the user is advised to wash dark colors separately to prevent dye transfer. The shirt should not be bleached, wrung, or tumble dried. For drying, it is suggested to lay the shirt flat in the shade, which helps maintain its shape and size. When it comes to ironing, the recommendation is to iron gently and avoid ironing on any print, embellishment, or embroidery to prevent damage.

As for fit, the shirt is described as offering "comfort" fitting, which likely means it is not too tight nor too loose, providing ease of movement and a relaxed appearance. The product description indicates that wearing this shirt with jeans and leather shoes would create a perfect semi-formal look.
