The image provided depicts a modern Esprit Athletic Black analog wristwatch, which embodies a classic design with a contemporary twist. It features a black dial set within a metallic case that measures 47 mm in diameter and 10 mm in case thickness, offering a substantial presence on the wrist.

The dial is round in shape and includes printed numbers in dark grey, each bordered by metallic lines, which adds to the visual appeal of the watch. These numbers offer clear legibility and are enhanced by fluorescence, which allows the wearer to read the time in low-light conditions.

One can observe three sub-dials on the main dial, signifying the watch's chronograph functionality. These sub-dials track minute, second, and hour-specific time intervals and include a timer feature. The presence of a chronograph function adds a dynamic and utilitarian aspect to the watch, catering to individuals who appreciate the convenience of measuring elapsed time.

A solid stainless steel case back is present, designed to enhance durability. This robust construction complements the water resistance capability of the watch up to 100 meters, which is particularly useful for activities such as swimming, making this timepiece versatile for both casual and sporty settings.

The bezel around the watch face is fixed, thus adding an additional layer of style and robustness to the overall design. It includes numbering that seems to be styled like a diver's watch but does not appear to be rotatable based on the visible design.

The leather strap features a classic black color that contrasts and complements the metallic elements of the watch case. The strap closes with a tang clasp, which is a traditional type of buckle common in many watch designs for its simplicity and reliability.

Overall, the product is designed to appeal to a broad market, from individuals looking for a modern and trendy wristwatch to those who appreciate durability and functionality in a timepiece. The Esprit brand is known for its affordable yet stylish watches, and this particular model fits well within their ethos of providing timeless accessories for a modern audience.
