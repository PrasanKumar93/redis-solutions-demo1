The image shows a wristwatch which aligns with the given product details. The watch has a rectangular stainless steel case that is embellished with crystals, providing an elegant and possibly feminine aesthetic. The crystals are likely meant to mimic the appearance of diamonds, offering a look that could be considered upscale or dressy.

The fixed bezel can be seen enclosing the watch face, and the band loops around this bezel, as mentioned in the description. This design choice might offer both a unique appearance and functional durability by reinforcing the attachment of the strap to the case.

The dial of the watch is grey and features an analog time display with the numerals 3, 6, 9, and 12 marked and the brand name positioned at what is described as the 5-hour marking. However, without a traditional dial layout, it is difficult to determine where the 5-hour mark would beâ€”it may be a typographical error in the provided details.

The grey textured leather strap complements the overall monochromatic tone of the watch, and it has a buckle clasp closure which is standard for many watch designs, providing security and adjustability on the wrist.

Additional details regarding functionality are provided, such as a quartz movement which is a common and reliable timekeeping mechanism. Having quartz movement suggests that the watch is likely powered by a battery. The mention of a screw to reset the time suggests that there is a crown on the side of the watch, which is standard for analog watches, used to adjust the time.

The watch is described as water-resistant for activities like hand washing. This indicates that it can withstand minor splashes of water but is not suitable for swimming, bathing, or similar activities.

Lastly, the watch comes with a 2-year warranty, which is a relatively standard duration for a warranty and provides some assurances regarding the quality and service support of the product.

Overall, the product offers a blend of practicality with a chic design and could be appealing to those looking for a stylish timepiece that can be worn on many occasions. The product description highlights both its aesthetic qualities and functional features.
