The product is a black, round neck, short-sleeved t-shirt. The material composition of the t-shirt is 57% cotton, 38% polyester, and 5% elastane, which suggests that the t-shirt is likely to be soft to the touch, stretchable due to elastane, and may have moisture-wicking properties due to polyester content. The addition of 5% elastane to the fabric blend provides a comfortable stretch, which can enhance the fit and allow for a range of movement.

It has a ribbed neckline, which typically indicates a reinforced, stretchy collar that should retain its shape over time. The presence of fabric tape detailing on the inseam of the collar often indicates a higher level of quality and attention to detail, as it can add to the comfort and durability of the t-shirt.

There is a brand logo at the back of the neck; however, I won't identify the brand or its logo. On the left sleeve, there's a collection logo, which is unspecified in your description, and the front features a graphic print with lettering. The graphic seems to be designed to pay homage to Usain Bolt, as mentioned in the product description, and it might feature imagery or iconography associated with him.

The t-shirt is engineered with USP moisture management technology. This is a feature designed to keep the wearer comfortable by efficiently moving perspiration away from the skin to the fabric surface, where it can evaporate quickly.

The fitting is described as "Regular," which typically means it is not overly fitted or too loose; it should provide a standard fit that is intended to suit the typical body shape.

The provided wash care instructions emphasize the need for a gentle machine wash using cool water, along with other care instructions such as not bleaching, tumble drying, ironing cool, and avoiding dry cleaning. These details are important as they help in maintaining the quality and appearance of the t-shirt over time.

Lastly, there's a suggestion to pair the t-shirt with jeans or shorts for a great look, which is reinforced by the image showing a male model (whose statistics are provided) wearing the t-shirt paired with jeans. The visual representation of the t-shirt on the model shows it worn in a casual, stylish manner suitable for everyday wear.
