The product is a fuchsia pink round neck t-shirt designed for comfort. The material composition of 70% modal and 30% polyester suggests that the t-shirt offers soft texture, breathability, and potentially good moisture-wicking properties due to the blend of these fibers. Modal is known for its softness and added comfort, while polyester provides durability and quick-drying capabilities. 

The t-shirt includes short sleeves and a vented hem, which typically contribute to a relaxed fit and ease of movement, making it suitable for casual wear or potentially light physical activities. The vented hem might also add a stylish element to the t-shirtâ€™s design, offering a contemporary look.

The graphic print on the front of the t-shirt is a significant design feature. In the image, we can see a large, bold graphic with text that reads, "THAT'S HOW WE DO IT," which gives the t-shirt a modern, urban style. The graphic is prominent and appears to be placed centrally on the chest area, drawing attention as the focal point of the design.

The washing instructions provided suggest the garment requires gentle care. It is advised to be delicately machine washed at 30 degrees Celsius using a mild detergent. The t-shirt should not be dry cleaned, tumble dried, wrung, scrubbed, or bleached. It should be dried flat in the shade, which is likely to help maintain its shape and color. Ironing must be done with caution, avoiding direct contact with the print or embroidery to prevent damage.

The model in the image is wearing a size M and it's mentioned that he has a height of 6 feet and shoulder width of 18 inches, which could be helpful information for potential buyers looking to understand how the t-shirt may fit. His posture and the way the t-shirt fits him suggest the item is true to a comfort fit label, offering a balance between a body-hugging and loose fit. 

Finally, the suggested styling of pairing this t-shirt with jeans and sports shoes implies versatility and highlights a casual, laid-back look, potentially appealing to a young, fashion-conscious audience. The description hints at a "cowboy" vibe that the t-shirt might evoke, though that aspect is more subject to personal interpretation based on the individual's style preferences.
