The curved hemline allows for the shirt to be worn both tucked in and untucked while still maintaining a polished appearance. As for the fit, the product description specifies it as 'Comfort,' likely meaning the shirt is designed to be relaxed rather than form-fitting or overly loose.

The wash care instructions are specific, advising only hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent, wash dark colours separately, no bleaching, wringing, or tumble drying, flat drying in shade, and mild ironing without ironing over prints, embellishments, or embroidery. These care instructions are typical for preserving the quality and color of the cotton fabric and any design details on the shirt.

The styling suggestion included is to pair this checked shirt with jeans and leather shoes for a perfect semi-formal look, indicating the shirt's flexibility in a wardrobe.
