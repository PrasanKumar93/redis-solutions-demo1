Based on the image provided, the product appears to be a wristwatch with the following characteristics:

1. Branding: The watch face contains the text "ESPRIT" which suggests that it is a wristwatch produced by Esprit, a fashion brand known for clothing, accessories, and watches.

2. Dial and Display: The watch has a black dial with white Arabic numerals for 12, 4, and 8 o'clock positions and index markers for the other hours. It includes three subdials which indicate that it has a chronograph function, allowing it to be used as a stopwatch. The presence of smaller markings around the circumference of the dial suggests a tachymeter or telemeter function.

3. Hands: The watch has luminous hands, which makes it easier to read the time in the dark. The main hands indicate hours, minutes, and there is a thin second hand, likely for chronograph timing.

4. Case and Bezel: The case of the watch has a textured bezel, which may provide a better grip for rotating it if it has rotatable functionality, typically associated with dive watches, but in this case may just be decorative. The metal appears to be stainless steel based on the color and sheen.

5. Crown and Pushers: The watch includes a crown and two push-buttons on the side, commonly used to control the chronograph functions.

6. Band: It has a black leather strap with what appears to be a crocodile pattern, suggesting a dressier look. 

7. Water Resistance: There is no visible indication of the level of water resistance.

Please note that without more product details, such as the case size, type of movement, glass material, water resistance rating, and specifics on additional features like whether it has a date function, more technical analysis cannot be provided. However, based on the image, it seems designed for a formal or business casual style, combining the functionality of a sports watch with a design suitable for everyday wear.
