Based on the provided product details and the image, the product is an analog wristwatch manufactured by Fastrack, which is tailored for women as part of their Essentials Collection. Here is a comprehensive analysis of the product:

**Design and Aesthetics:**
- The wristwatch has a sleek and stylish design, appealing to women who appreciate elegant accessories that can be worn every day.
- It features a unique triangular dial, which distinguishes it from more traditional round or square watches, adding a modern and avant-garde touch to its design.
- The metallic strap includes a butterfly clasp, which is known for its comfort and security on the wrist. The clasp also contributes to the overall style of the watch, enhancing its elegant appearance.
- The white dial incorporates the Fastrack brand name and logo at the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions, respectively, providing a simple yet sophisticated face with minimalistic branding.
- The metallic case with a fixed bezel contributes to the watch's durability as well as its visual appeal. The bezel's fixed nature means it's purely decorative and does not rotate like some sports or diver watches.

**Functionality and Features:**
- The case diameter is mentioned as 20mm, making it relatively small and suitable for those who prefer more delicate watches or have slender wrists.
- The case thickness is 6mm which indicates a slim profile that won't be bulky on the wrist.
- This watch uses quartz movement for timekeeping, which is known for its accuracy and low maintenance compared to mechanical movements.
- A screw on the side of the watch case is provided to reset the time. This is likely the crown of the watch, which when pulled out allows the user to set the time and when pushed in ensures the watch is water-resistant.
- The solid case back made of stainless steel further adds to its sturdiness and longevity, protecting the internal components of the watch.
- The water-resistant feature up to 30 meters allows for use in situations like swimming in shallow water or wearing it in the rain without damaging the watch.

**Analysis of the Image:**
- The image shows the watch at an angle that highlights the triangular shape of the dial and the sheen of the metallic strap and case.
- The reflective metallic surfaces in the image suggest high-quality material and craftsmanship. However, due to reflection, some details on the strap and near the clasp area may not be as clear.
- The lighting and angle of the photo emphasize the three-dimensional qualities of the watch, showcasing the curvature of the bezel and the contour of the strap as it wraps around.

In conclusion, the Fastrack analog wristwatch from the Essentials Collection appears to be a stylish, durable, and practical accessory for women that balances everyday functionality with an elegant, modern design. The watch's distinct features, such as its triangular dial and water resistance, make it a notable product within its category.
