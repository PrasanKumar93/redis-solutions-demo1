The product depicted in the image is a purple tunic top with kaftan sleeves. From the product details provided, we know that the top is made of 100% viscose, which is a semi-synthetic type of rayon fabric known for its silk-like feel and gentle draping qualities. The purple color of the tunic makes it vibrant and eye-catching.

The top features a floral print, which is visible in the image, displaying a variety of shapes and colors that make the overall design look ornamental and intricate. The print consists of multiple rows of different patterns, creating a sort of patchwork effect, each with varying shapes, including paisley and foliage. The colors used in the print include shades of blue, white, and lighter purples, which stand out against the deep purple background.

The top also comes with a looped belt around the waist, which is not clearly visible in the image, suggesting that it may be a subtle feature or removed for the purpose of the photograph.

In terms of fitting, the product description states that the tunic top is slim fitting, which often refers to a cut that is narrower and closer to the body, designed to accentuate the wearer's silhouette. The top appears to taper slightly at the waist in the image, which could be indicative of this slim fit.

For wash care, the instructions recommend machine or hand washing the garment in mild detergent and caution against using bleach or wringing the top dry. The care instructions also advise drying the top in the shade rather than direct sunlight and to iron at medium heat but avoiding the iron on the print to preserve the integrity of the design.

The model in the image wears a size M and her statistics are provided, with a height of 5'7" and measurements of a 33" chest and a 25" waist. In the image, she is wearing the tunic top over what appears to be dark jeans or leggings, which aligns with the suggested pairing of the top with slacks or denims. She has a straight posture which allows the garment's cut and design to be clearly seen. Her hair is styled straight and her makeup is subtle, ensuring that the focus remains on the tunic top itself.

Overall, the tunic top seems to offer a blend of traditional design elements with a modern fit, making it suitable for both casual and slightly dressy occasions depending on the accessories and bottoms it is paired with.
