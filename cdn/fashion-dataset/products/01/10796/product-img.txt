The product depicted in the image is a red, black, and white check shirt designed for a semi-formal look. The shirt, as described in the provided details, is made from 100% cotton, ensuring breathability and comfort for the wearer. It features a tipped collar and a full front button placket, which is a classic design for casual to semi-formal shirts. The short sleeves are in line with the description and show that the shirt is likely intended for warm weather or for a more relaxed look that still retains a degree of smartness.

The shirt also includes buttoned flap pockets on either chest, which are visible in the image and add both functionality and style to the garment. Embroidered branding is mentioned to be on the back chest, although this detail cannot be assessed from the current frontal image of the garment. The shirt showcases stitch detailing, which points to a well-constructed garment that could potentially hold up well with usage, and a curved hemline that is characteristic of shirts intended to be worn untucked, adding to the casual appeal.

For care, the shirt requires only hand wash in cold water with a mild detergent, which is a typical instruction for preserving the color and fabric quality of a cotton garment. Itâ€™s crucial to wash dark colors separately to avoid any color transfer, and to avoid bleaching, wringing, or tumble drying to maintain the shirt's shape and color integrity. The shirt should be dried flat in the shade to prevent any unnecessary stretching or color fading due to sun exposure. Ironing should be mild, and direct ironing on print, embellishments, or embroidery should be avoided to prevent damage.

Regarding the fitting, the product is designated as 'Comfort', suggesting it likely has a relaxed cut that isn't too tight, allowing ease of movement and a laid-back feel. This cut would be suitable for a variety of body types and could be a versatile addition to an everyday wardrobe. Paired with jeans and leather shoes, as suggested, the shirt would complete a look that's casual yet put-together.

The model in the image wears a size M, and his statistics are provided to give potential buyers an idea of how the shirt might fit a person of a similar build. However, without additional context or images from different angles, it is not possible to assess the entire fit and fall of the shirt.

Overall, the shirt appears to be a trendy and practical garment suitable for casual and semi-formal settings. The plaid pattern is timeless and versatile, which could make this shirt a staple in someone's wardrobe.
