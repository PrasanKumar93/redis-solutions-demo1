The product in the image is a long-sleeved blue shirt featuring white stripes. The shirt is tailored with a focus on comfort and is made from 100% cotton, which suggests that it should be soft, breathable, and suitable for extended wear. The collar tips are notable and add to the shirt's style, accompanied by a full front button placket. 

The shirt includes two buttoned flap pockets on the chest, which provide utility as well as an aesthetic detail. Attention to branding is subtle, with a small logo or emblem evident on the left hem, which is a common placement for branding that balances visibility without being overwhelming.

From the product details, there is specific care information that includes washing by hand in cold water with a mild detergent, which is important for preserving the fabric's quality and appearance. Instructions to wash dark colours separately, not using bleach, wringing, or tumble drying, and laying the shirt flat to dry in the shade help maintain the shape and color of the shirt. A mild iron is recommended, but importantly, not on any print or embellishments to avoid damage.

The shirt is styled on the model in a semi-formal fashion, suitable to be paired with jeans and leather shoes. Based on the model's measurements (wearing size M, with a height of 6 feet and 18-inch shoulders), potential buyers can gauge the shirt's fit and how it might look on a similarly built person. The sleeves are styled unrolled, but the product description suggests they can be rolled up for a more casual look, which can be a versatile feature for various occasions.

Overall, the shirt appears to be well-constructed, designed for both style and comfort, and aimed at consumers looking for versatile semi-formal wear.
