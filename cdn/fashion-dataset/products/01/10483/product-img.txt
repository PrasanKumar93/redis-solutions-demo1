Composition: The product description states that it is made of 100% cotton, which suggests that it would be breathable and comfortable for everyday wear due to cotton's natural softness and moisture-wicking properties. The t-shirt also features a ribbed neckline, which can help retain shape over time, with tape detailing on the inseam of the collar adding to the garment's durability and finish. The thread detailing on the shoulders and behind the collar could serve both a decorative and reinforcing function.

Wash Care: The care instructions provided suggest machine washing the t-shirt in cold water to preserve the fabric and the print, not tumble drying, turning it inside out before drying to protect the print, and using a warm iron while avoiding ironing directly on the print. These instructions are quite typical for printed garments to ensure longevity.

Additional Details: The t-shirt is part of the "Resident Earth collection" from what appears to be the brand "Flying Machine," as mentioned in the product description. The message "Stop! Not from moving ahead but from walking over!" printed on the t-shirt conveys a social or environmental message, which could appeal to customers who are interested in global consciousness themes.

The image shows the t-shirt as it would be worn in real life, which is helpful for potential customers to gauge how it might look on them.
