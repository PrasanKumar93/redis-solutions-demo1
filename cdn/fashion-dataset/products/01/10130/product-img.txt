Based on the provided product details and the image, here's a comprehensive analysis of the Esprit Pure Effect analog wrist watch:

**Design and Aesthetics:**
The watch features a classic yet contemporary design, blending traditional aesthetics with a modern twist. The rectangular dial shape is a departure from the more common round designs, which may appeal to those looking for something unique. The black textured dial with the brand name clearly visible at the 6 o'clock position provides a sleek and professional look, suitable for various occasions.

**Materials and Build Quality:**
The watch possesses a stainless steel case that offers durability and a premium feel. The bezel includes crystal embellishments that add an element of style and sophistication, while also enhancing the watch's visual appeal. The calfskin leather strap exhibits subtle brand detailing, suggesting a focus on branding and quality, and it secures with a tang clasp which is a standard closure type for ease of use and reliability.

**Size and Comfort:**
With a case diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 7 mm, the watch appears to be relatively small and slim, making it potentially well-suited for those with smaller wrists or for users who prefer a more understated wrist presence. The dimensions suggest it would be comfortable for everyday wear, without being too bulky or heavy.

**Durability Features:**
The watch is equipped with scratch-resistant mineral crystal glass, which should keep the watch face relatively free from scratches from day-to-day wear. The water resistance feature implies that the watch can withstand splashes or brief immersion in water, such as washing hands or a car, but it is likely not suitable for swimming or diving.

**Movement and Functionality:**
It operates on a quartz movement, which is known for keeping accurate time with minimal maintenance required. The presence of a screw for resetting the time is a standard feature that allows users to set the time as needed. The description does not detail whether the watch includes additional features like date display or luminosity, which are often found in analog watches.

**Overall Impression:**
The Esprit Pure Effect analog wristwatch appears to be a well-designed, fashionable, and practical timepiece. It's positioned as an affordable option for those seeking a mix of modern design with timeless watch aesthetics. Suitable for both casual and formal settings, the watch is likely to appeal to individuals who value style and practicality.

Looking at the actual image, the watch matches the description with its rectangular dial, stainless steel accents around the case, and the leather strap. The image showcases the watch details clearly, such as the textured dial and brand markings, which helps in conveying the product's quality and design.
