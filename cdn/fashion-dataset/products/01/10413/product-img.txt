The t-shirt has a graphic print on the front, which features a colorful and somewhat abstract design. The text “scratching his head” is printed below the graphic, potentially adding a humorous or whimsical element to the design.

The fit of the t-shirt is described as 'comfort,' which could indicate a regular or slightly relaxed fit, meaning it should not be too tight or too loose on the body. This often appeals to a wide range of body types and is suitable for a casual, laid-back look.

The care instructions are quite specific, emphasizing the need for a delicate machine wash at 30 degrees using a mild detergent and advising against dry cleaning, tumble drying, wringing, scrubbing, bleaching, and direct ironing on the print or embroidery. These guidelines are important to maintain the integrity of the fabric and the graphic print. It is also recommended to dry the t-shirt flat in the shade and to use a warm iron, which can help prevent shrinkage and color fading.
