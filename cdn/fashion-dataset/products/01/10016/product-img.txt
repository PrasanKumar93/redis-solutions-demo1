- Bleach should be avoided probably because it may strip the color or damage the fabric.
- The dress should not be soaked and ought to be removed promptly from the machine, suggesting a vulnerability to color fading or shape alteration when wet.
- Line drying in the shade will prevent excessive shrinkage and fading from sun exposure.
- Warm iron only suggests that high heat could damage the fabric or print, and ironing directly on the print or embroidery could harm the design.

Overall, the product seems to be a practical and stylish item for children's wear, requiring a bit of care in washing to ensure longevity. The design and color make it a cheerful option for various informal occasions.
