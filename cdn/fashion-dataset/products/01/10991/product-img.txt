This is a brown, round-neck t-shirt made from 100% cotton material, featuring short sleeves and a graphic print on the front. The graphic print has a playful, edgy design with the words "HEAVY METAL" prominently presented, suggesting a theme that resonates with fans of the music genre or those who appreciate a rock-inspired aesthetic. The color scheme of the graphic includes red, white, and shades of blue, which stand out against the t-shirt's brown background.

The fit of the t-shirt is described as "comfort," which suggests it has a relaxed fit conducive to everyday wear and ease of movement. The model in the image appears to be wearing the t-shirt in a size that offers a comfortable fit on the body without being overly tight or loose.

The care instructions emphasize the need for gentle handling, recommending hand-washing in cool water at 30 degrees and advising against using bleach or scrubbing the fabric. It is also suggested to dry the garment flat in shade after turning it inside out to prevent damage to the print and to use a warm iron on the reverse to avoid direct contact with the graphic design.

The product description suggests styling the t-shirt with jeans and sports shoes or shorts and sandals for a casual, cool look. The description includes a note on the model's statistics, stating that he is wearing a size M, is 5'11" tall, and has 18" shoulders. This information can help potential buyers gauge the t-shirt's fit and size on their body type.

The image itself shows a clear, front-facing view of the t-shirt as worn by a male model. He is poised with one hand casually touching his hip, providing a natural, approachable demeanor that allows the t-shirt to be the central focus of the image. The image seems to be professionally taken with good lighting that accurately represents the color and details of the t-shirt, which is important for online shoppers who rely on visuals to make their purchasing decisions.
