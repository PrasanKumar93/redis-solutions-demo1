The product is a white, round neck t-shirt made of 100% cotton, which indicates that it should provide a high level of comfort and breathability, making it suitable for various occasions, including casual wear and sports activities. The t-shirt features a graphic print on the front, which consists of words and abstract designs in a bright yellow colour that stands out against the white fabric, adding a vibrant and eye-catching element to the garment.

The neckline is ribbed and includes a grey fabric tape inseam, which not only adds a subtle contrast to the design but also serves to reinforce the neck area, potentially offering greater durability and maintaining the garment's shape over time. The sleeves are short, making the t-shirt appropriate for warmer weather or physical activities where freedom of movement is desired.

In terms of care instructions, the product requires machine washing at a cold temperature (30 degrees Celsius) with similar colours, which is aimed at preserving the fabric's quality and preventing colour transfer. The t-shirt should not be bleached, as bleaching agents could damage the material or alter the graphic print's colours. The low tumble dry setting and the immediate removal of the t-shirt from the machine once dried are recommended to avoid creasing or colour fading. While the t-shirt can be ironed, it's important to avoid ironing over the design to prevent damage. Additionally, the shirt should not be dry cleaned.

Style-wise, the product description suggests that this t-shirt can be paired with sportswear trousers or shorts and sports shoes for athletic activities or with jeans and suede shoes for a more casual, stylish look. The versatility of the t-shirt's design makes it adaptable for various styles, whether aiming for a sporty or a relaxed, fashionable appearance. The slogan "No Gravity" featured in the graphic print might appeal to individuals interested in sports, urban fashion, or those who enjoy a playful and bold statement piece.
