**Composition & Construction:**
The shirt is characterized by white full sleeves with dark blue stripesâ€”a classic and professional pattern suitable for various formal settings. It is made of a cotton and polyester blend, which combines the comfort and breathability of cotton with the durability and wrinkle resistance of polyester. The shirt features a patch pocket on the left chest, which adds functionality and a touch of style.

The curved hemline suggests that the shirt can be worn tucked or untucked while maintaining a polished look.

**Fitting:**

**Wash Care:**
The wash care instructions are comprehensive, ensuring the longevity of the shirt. It is advised to be machine or hand washed at 40 degrees Celsius, and dark colours should be washed separately to prevent dye transfer. The shirt should not be bleached and can be tumble dried on a normal setting. For a crisp appearance, a hot iron is recommended, which is especially important for maintaining the sharp look of a formal shirt.

**Styling Tips:**
The product description suggests pairing the shirt with well-fitting formal trousers and a pair of leather shoes for a complete office look, which is a standard suggestion for business attire.

The model is wearing a size M, and his height is 6 feet with shoulder width of 18 inches. From the image, it appears that the shirt fits the model well, which helps potential buyers gauge the fit of the shirt based on their own measurements.
