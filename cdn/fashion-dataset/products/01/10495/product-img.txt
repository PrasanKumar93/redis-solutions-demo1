The product depicted in the image is an aqua blue plaid check short-sleeved shirt, designed to offer a blend of style and comfort. The shirt is made from 100% cotton, which suggests that the fabric should be soft, breathable, and comfortable for all-day wear. This natural fiber is ideal for warmer climates and for people preferring materials that allow for good air circulation.

The shirt features a buttoned placket, which is a standard design element for ease of putting on and taking off. It also comes with patch pockets on the front secured with buttoned flaps, adding to the overall functionality and style of the shirt. These pockets can be useful for carrying small items and add a casual, practical touch to the garment.

The curved hemline of the shirt contributes to a relaxed and modern aesthetic, allowing the shirt to be worn untucked while still maintaining a neat appearance. This design detail can also provide a more flattering fit around the hips.

In terms of care, the shirt requires machine wash in cold water, highlighting the ease of maintenance. However, it is advised to avoid tumble drying, to turn the shirt inside out before drying, not to dry it in direct sunlight, and to use a warm iron. This may be to preserve the integrity of the fabric and the plaid print. It is also important to note that ironing should not be done on the print or embroidery to avoid damage.

The fitting specified is "Regular," which typically means the shirt should be neither too tight nor too loose, ensuring a comfortable fit for a variety of body shapes.

Stylistically, the product description suggests pairing this shirt with jeans and sports shoes, indicating that the shirt is versatile enough for casual outgoings and everyday wear. The model in the image is wearing the shirt in such a way that it shows how it fits and looks on a person, which is helpful for potential buyers to visualize the product on themselves.

The model's statistics are mentioned for reference, providing customers with context for how the shirt may fit on their own body. The model wears size M in t-shirts and has a height of 5â€™8" with a chest measurement of 33", which should help customers gauge the size and fit of the garment with respect to their own measurements.

Overall, the shirt's design and stated care requirements reflect a product aimed at fashion-conscious individuals looking for comfort combined with a laid-back style.
