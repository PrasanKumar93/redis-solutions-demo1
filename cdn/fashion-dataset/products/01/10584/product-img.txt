Design & Aesthetics:
- The watch has a boldly styled octagonal face, which gives it a distinctive, modern appearance divergent from the more common round or square watch faces.
- The black coating on the stainless steel case offers a sleek, sporty vibe and also could contribute to the durability of the watch's exterior.
- It features a vibrant yellow rubber strap with branding, which provides a striking color contrast against the black case and also suggests a comfortable and secure fit for a range of wrist sizes.
- The tang clasp with brand inscription not only ensures the watch stays securely on the wrist but also adds to the overall branded experience of the product.

Dial & Functionality:
- The black busy dial with dots on the numbers offers a textured look that adds depth to the dial, enhancing the visual appeal of the watch.
- The metallic hands are clearly visible against the textured black dial for easy time reading.

- The metallic crown on the side of the watch is used to adjust the time, date, and day, which is a standard feature in analog watches.

Durability & Quality:
