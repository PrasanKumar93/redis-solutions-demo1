Starting from the top, we observe a metal button and zipper closure, consistent with the given description. The fit around the waist appears snug and comfortable. The jeans feature a looped waistband, and though not entirely visible, there could be a brand name appliqued there as mentioned in the details.

The front view showcases two insert pockets, one on each side. There is visible stud detailing around the pockets, adding a subtle flair to the design. The embroidered brand logo is described to be above the left pocket, however, this detail is not prominently visible in the current angle of the image.

As the image doesn't provide a rear view, we cannot confirm the two patch pockets on the back nor the stitch detailing. Similarly, the frayed look with the patch on the right leg is not visible from the angle shown. This information, however, gives potential buyers important details about the design elements and quality of craftsmanship.

The denim fabric has a faded and whiskered appearance, consistent with trendy washed jeans designs, and is made of 100% cotton as per the product specifications. This implies breathability and comfort, although the lack of elasticity in pure cotton may affect flexibility and fit.

The color of the jeans is a classic blue, which is versatile and can be easily paired with a range of top-wear options. The jeans are styled with a casual grey T-shirt and boat shoes, appealing to a demographic looking for casual and comfortable styling.
