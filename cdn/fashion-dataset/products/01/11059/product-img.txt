The provided image shows a man modeling a full-sleeved formal shirt. The shirt is styled with leaf green and white checks and features black accents, creating a professional yet stylish appearance. It is made from a cotton and polyester blend, which suggests that the fabric will likely offer both comfort and durability, in addition to making the shirt easier to care for compared to pure cotton shirts.

The design includes a patch pocket on the left chest, which is a common feature in men's formal shirts, adding to its functional aspect. The shirt also has a full-length buttoned placket, which is consistent with traditional formal shirt designs, and a slightly curved hemline. This hemline enhances the shirt's versatility, allowing it to be worn tucked or untucked while still maintaining a neat appearance.

The product details indicate that the shirt comes with a specific set of wash care instructions. These include: machine or hand washing in cold water at 30Â°C with a mild detergent, washing dark colours separately, not using bleach, tumble drying low, drying in the shade, and using a hot iron. These instructions are important for maintaining the shirt's colour and shape.

For sizing, the shirt is described as having a regular fit, which is designed to accommodate a wide range of body types comfortably. The model in the image is reportedly 6 feet tall with an 18-inch shoulder width and is wearing a size 40. This gives potential buyers an idea of how the shirt may fit on their own bodies.

Overall, the shirt appears to be an attractive option for those seeking to elevate their formal wardrobe. It promises to combine a crisp, fresh look with comfort, making it suitable for office wear or smart-casual occasions. It has been styled in the image with what appears to be dark formal trousers and is recommended to be paired with well-fitting trousers and a pair of leather shoes to create a polished ensemble, as per the product description.
