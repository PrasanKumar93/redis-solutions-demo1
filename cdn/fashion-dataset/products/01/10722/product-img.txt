The t-shirt has a ribbed neckline which typically provides a bit of stretch and helps the neckline hold its shape over time.

The short sleeves of the t-shirt make it suitable for warmer weather or for layering under other clothing.

It is important not to bleach or soak the t-shirt and to remove it immediately after washing instead of letting it lay on itself when wet, which can prevent discoloration or shape distortion.
