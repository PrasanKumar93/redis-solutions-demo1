- The slim fit suggests that the t-shirt is designed to be close-fitting, enhancing the wearer's silhouette.

**Wash Care:**
- The garment requires hand wash only in cold water with a mild detergent; this is typical for delicate fabrics that could be damaged in a machine wash.

**Styling Tips:**
- The product description suggests pairing the t-shirt with denim and funky canvas shoes for a cool, casual look, which can be considered a popular choice for a relaxed yet stylish outfit.
- The ruffled sleeves and frilled placket make it an appropriate choice for occasions that call for a bit of flair, from casual outings to more dressed-up events if accessorized appropriately.
