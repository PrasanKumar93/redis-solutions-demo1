The product depicted in the image is a pair of men's black formal trousers featuring a pinstripe design. Based on the detailed product description provided and the image itself, the following analysis can be performed:

**Composition:**
- Material: The trousers are made from a blend of polyester and viscose, which typically makes for a garment that is both durable and retains a slight sheen, while also having a softer feel than polyester alone.
- Design: They have a flat front which is a common and popular style for formal trousers, offering a smooth and clean look.
- Pockets: There are two side pockets and two buttoned welt pockets on the back. The side pockets are standard for trousers, while the welt pockets on the back with buttons add to the formal aesthetic and utility of the trousers.
- Closure: The trousers use a metal zipper and button closure, which is standard for men's formal wear.

**Fitting:**
- The trousers have a "regular" fit, which generally means they aren't too tight or too loose and should be comfortable for a wide range of body types.

**Wash Care:**
- The wash care instructions suggest machine washing the trousers inside-out in warm water, which can help protect the color and fabric. 
- Bleaching is not recommended, which is typical for colored fabrics to prevent color loss.
- Tumble drying on low and drying inside out in the shade is advised to avoid any potential shrinkage or fading due to high temperatures and direct sunlight.
- Warm ironing is allowed which means that any wrinkles that form after washing can be ironed out without damaging the fabric.
