The product presented in the image is a green and white plaid checked full-sleeve shirt, consistent with the description provided. The shirt features a prominent plaid pattern, which is casual yet stylish, suitable for various occasions that require a smart-casual look. Below are the details based on both the provided description and the image:

Composition:
- The shirt is made of 100% cotton with a 100% cotton lining, ensuring breathability and comfort. The fabric choice is suitable for all-day wear and can be an advantage in warmer climates or during spring and summer seasons.
- A full-length buttoned placket is visible, running down the center front of the shirt, which is typical for such garments. The buttons appear to be matched in color to integrate well with the shirt's design.
- There is a mid-sleeve button detail, which offers the wearers the option to roll up the sleeves and secure them, as shown in the image. This feature combined with contrasting colored cuffs (dark turquoise) enhances the shirt's versatility, as it can be styled differently based on personal preference or the weather.
- There are two chest pockets, which add both functionality and an element of design to the shirt. The right pocket has a brand tab positioned just above it, emphasizing the brand's identity without being overly prominent.
- The shirt features brand embroidery on the right shoulder, which might not be clearly visible in the image but is mentioned in the product details. Shoulder panels are also mentioned, which would typically be consistent with the styling of such shirts to provide structure and durability in that area.

Fitting:
- The shirt is described as having a slim fit, which is supported by the appearance in the image where the shirt contours comfortably around the model's torso, suggesting a modern and tailored silhouette. Sizes will vary, and customers should consult the size chart and potentially the model's statistics for a better estimation of fit.

Wash care:
- The care instructions indicate the need for only a hand wash in cold water using a mild detergent, which is important for preserving both the color and the fabric integrity. 
- Users are advised not to wring or bleach the garment, which could cause damage or discoloration.
- The shirt should be dried flat in the shade to prevent any distortion or fading from the sun.
- A warm iron can be used for getting rid of wrinkles and maintaining a crisp appearance.

Style Suggestion:
- The shirt is recommended to be paired with formal pants, denims, or corduroys along with black footwear, supporting both formal and casual looks. Its plaid design makes it flexible enough to be dressed up for a business casual environment or dressed down for a relaxed weekend.

Model statistics:
- The model in the picture wears size M in shirts, has a height of 6 feet, and shoulder breadth of 18 inches, which serves as a guide for potential customers to relate the fit and appearance of the shirt to their own measurements.

In summary, based on the analysis, this shirt seems to be a versatile addition to a casual or smart-casual wardrobe, with features that allow for varied styling and a composition that prioritizes comfort.
