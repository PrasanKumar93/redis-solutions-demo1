The product depicted in the image is a men's full-sleeve casual shirt featuring a green and blue plaid checked pattern with black accents. The shirt is fabricated from 100% cotton with a lining also made of cotton, ensuring that the garment is breathable and comfortable for all-day wear. The shirt exhibits a full-length buttoned placket and includes a unique design element of a mid-sleeve button flap that allows the wearer to secure rolled-up sleeves neatly. 

There is an embroidery detail on the right shoulder, adding a subtle branding element that does not overpower the design of the shirt. Additionally, the shoulder panels are made of the same fabric as the shirt, providing consistency in the design. Practicality is offered through two chest pockets, which are both a style and a utility feature. A brand tab is also featured above the right pocket, which contributes to the shirt's branded appeal.

Care instructions for the shirt indicate that it should be hand washed only in cold water with a mild detergent, suggesting the need for gentle handling to maintain the shirt's longevity and prevent shrinkage or color fading. Customers are advised against wringing or bleaching the shirt, and it should be flat dried in the shade to preserve its shape and coloration. A warm iron is recommended for removing wrinkles and maintaining a neat appearance.

The shirt is described as having a slim fit, which generally means it is designed to closely fit the contours of the body, offering a more fitted and modern silhouette. According to the product details, the model in the image is 6 feet tall with an 18-inch shoulder breadth and is wearing a size 40, providing a reference for customers in terms of sizing and fit.

Overall, the shirt appears to be a versatile garment that could be paired with various types of trousers, such as formal pants, denim, or corduroys, and styled with black footwear to achieve different looks, ranging from formal to casual. The plaid pattern and color scheme make the shirt appropriate for various casual situations where style and comfort are desired.
