The product in the image is a white and blue plaid check shirt with red accents. The pattern is consistent with the typical plaid design, featuring crisscrossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colors. The shirt appears to be made of 100% cotton, as indicated in the product details, which suggests that it has a comfortable feel and good breathability, suitable for casual wear and potentially for all-day use due to its material's lightweight and soft nature.

The shirt features long sleeves with buttoned flaps, which gives the wearer the option to adjust the sleeve length according to their comfort and preference. This is a useful feature for adapting to different temperatures or for a varying look. Moreover, there are two patch pockets on the chest with buttoned flaps, and the left chest pocket has an embroidered brand logo, which is a common design feature to add brand recognition and detail.

The collar has tape detailing on the inseam, which is likely to provide reinforcement, and it adds a subtle design detail that enhances the overall look of the shirt. The shirt is also described to have a curved hemline, a design choice that provides a flattering silhouette and allows for the shirt to be worn untucked while maintaining a neat appearance.

Regarding fit, the shirt is described as having a regular fit, which usually means it’s not too tight or too loose—a versatile fit suitable for various body types.

The washing instructions indicate that the shirt should be machine washed cold to prevent shrinkage or color bleeding, which is typical for cotton garments. It is advised not to tumble dry, which could be due to the risk of shrinkage or loss of shape. Instead, the shirt should be turned inside out before drying to preserve its color, and it should not be dried in direct sunlight to avoid fading. The shirt should be ironed with warm heat, and care must be taken not to iron on the print, likely to avoid damaging the embroidered logo or other printed areas.
