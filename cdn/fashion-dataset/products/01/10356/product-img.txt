The product depicted in the image is a blue melange shirt designed for formal wear. The shirt is made from 100% cotton, which suggests that it should be comfortable to wear and breathable. Based on the details provided, the shirt features full-length sleeves with buttoned cuffs, which add to its formal design. Additionally, it has a tipped collar that gives a neat and crisp appearance, along with a front button placket for ease of wearing and a clean look. 

The left chest of the shirt has a pocket with an embroidered logo that represents the Big Ben, adding a subtle branded element to the design. The garment's curved hem enhances its style and may also facilitate wearing the shirt untucked if one chooses, to create a more casual appearance.

The fitting is described as comfortable, which could indicate that the shirt is cut to provide a relaxed fit, enabling easy movement and is not overly restrictive.

The wash care instructions are comprehensive and indicate a need for gentle care to maintain the shirt's quality and appearance. The shirt should be washed delicately at 30 degrees Celsius with a mild detergent, not dry cleaned, and should avoid tumble drying, wringing, scrubbing, or bleaching. It should be dried flat in the shade to prevent distortion and avoid direct ironing on prints or embroidery, which suggests there may be some decorative elements that require special care. A warm iron is recommended to keep it looking crisp.

The product description mentions that pairing the shirt with formal trousers and black leather footwear will complete the classic look, positioning the shirt as ideal for formal occasions or the workplace. Additionally, the model statistics provide a reference for potential buyers. The model is 6 feet tall with 18-inch shoulders and wears size M, which helps customers gauge the size and fit of the shirt in relation to their own measurements.

The image shows the shirt worn by a male model who pairs it with what appears to be light-colored jeans, demonstrating how the shirt may also be styled in a semi-formal or smart-casual context. The model’s posture and the way the shirt is worn—fully buttoned up, sleeves neatly rolled up—contribute to presenting the shirt's fit and style effectively.
