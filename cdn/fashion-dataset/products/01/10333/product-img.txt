Based on the provided product details and the image, I will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the leather belt:

1. **Material Quality**: The belt is made of chocolate brown full-grain leather, which suggests it is of high quality. Full-grain leather is known for its durability, strength, and ability to age well, developing a unique patina over time.

2. **Design and Style**: The belt has a classic design, which makes it suitable for various occasions and attire, ranging from formal to casual. The chocolate brown color is versatile and can complement many other colors in a wardrobe.

3. **Buckle Type**: The belt features a tang clasp, also known as a pin buckle, which is a traditional buckle style. It provides a secure fit and is easy to adjust. The buckle looks to be made of a polished metal, likely a silver-colored alloy, which adds a subtle shine to the belt's appearance.

4. **Adjustability**: There are holes punched into the belt to customize the fit. This allows the wearer to adjust the belt to their exact waist size for comfort and proper function.

5. **Brand Detail**: According to the product details, the brand logo is embossed on the tail of the belt. While this is not visible in the image provided, an embossed logo is a common method for branding and can also be a sign of authenticity.

6. **Length**: The specific length mentioned is 87 cm. This size information is crucial for potential buyers to ensure they select a belt that fits. Customers would need to measure their waist or compare it with their existing belts to see if this length is suitable for them.

7. **Care Instructions**: The product details recommend using a brass polisher to maintain the shine of the buckle, indicating that the buckle might be brass plated or has brass elements. Additionally, the recommendation to use a leather conditioner suggests that the belt's longevity and appearance can be maintained through proper care.

8. **Image Analysis**: The image of the belt clearly shows the texture of the leather, the color of the belt, the buckle style, and the holes for adjustability. The image seems to be of high resolution with a white background, which is typical for e-commerce product images to ensure that all details are apparent to potential customers.

In summary, the belt appears to be a well-made, stylish, and functional accessory that could appeal to individuals seeking a durable and classic belt. The product information provided offers potential buyers enough detail to make an informed decision on their purchase, while the image accurately represents the product, which is essential for online shopping.
