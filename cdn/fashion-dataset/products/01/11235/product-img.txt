The product depicted in the image is a pair of washed blue skinny jeans designed for a mid-rise, skinny fit. The jeans are primarily composed of cotton (99.4%) with a small amount of spandex (0.6%), which suggests that they are primarily made of a natural, breathable fabric with a hint of stretch for comfort and a better fit.

The product features include:

1. Color: The jeans have a washed blue color, which indicates a faded or slightly distressed look that is commonly found in denim fashion. This style is versatile and can match with a wide range of tops and footwear.

2. Pockets: There are two insert pockets on the front side and two patch pockets on the back. The pockets provide practicality and are a standard feature in jeans. The thread detailing on the back pockets adds to the visual appeal and is characteristic of denim styling.

3. Branding: There's a brand patch appliqued on the waistband at the back, a common practice for branding jeans which also provides consumers with a recognizable mark of the brand's identity.

4. Closure: The closure system consists of a metal zipper and button, standard for most jeans and reliable for everyday wear.

5. Fit: The jeans are described as having a mid-rise and skinny fit, which suggests that they sit at the natural waistline and are fitted through the hips and legs. The length of the trousers worn by the model is 39", which is information valuable for customers looking for a certain length.

Regarding the care of the product, the washing instructions emphasize:

- Machine wash cold: This helps prevent excessive shrinkage and color fading.
- Do not tumble dry: Tumble drying can cause shrinkage and damage to the fabric, especially with the presence of spandex.
- Turn inside out before drying: This helps minimize color fading and protects the outer surface.
- Don't dry in direct sunlight: Sunlight can cause the color to fade unevenly.
- Use warm iron: This is a standard care instruction for denim to remove wrinkles without damaging the fabric.
- Do not iron on print: If there is any printed detailing on the jeans, this caution helps prevent damage to the design.
