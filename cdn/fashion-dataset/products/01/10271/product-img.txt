**Design & Style:**
- The sandals exhibit a feminine design with knotted strap detailing across the forefoot and midfoot regions, offering a combination of aesthetic appeal and security for the foot.

- There is a textured rubber outsole with an engraved design, as mentioned, which would contribute to grip and traction. The image does not detail the underside of the shoe, so the pattern cannot be assessed visually.

**Shoe Care:**

- It also advises wiping the surface with a soft, clean cloth or brush to remove dust, which is standard for leather goods, emphasizing the need for gentle cleaning.
- The recommendation against machine washing or using a drier underscores the need to protect the leather from harsh conditions that could damage it.
- Storing away from direct sunlight is common advice for leather products, as prolonged exposure to the sun can cause fading and drying out of the material.
