The image depicts a male model showcasing a full-sleeve button-up shirt with dark blue and white gingham checks. The shirt appears to be made of 100% cotton and features a slim fit, which can be observed from the tailored appearance around the model's torso. The shirt has a patch pocket on the left chest, and there seems to be an embroidered logo on the pocket, although the image does not allow for the identification of the brand based on the logo. The shirt also has a full-length buttoned placket which is common in formal or semi-formal shirts.

Additionally, the description mentions godet inserts on the sides which are extra pieces of fabric that can add width to the shirt and a curved hemline, both of which are typical features in contemporary men's fashion. The curved hemline is visible at the bottom of the shirt and allows for a more stylish untucked look, should the wearer choose to wear it that way.

The button plackets and the cuffs of the sleeves have a contrasting dark inner lining, which adds a subtle stylish detail that makes the shirt a bit more distinctive. The model has rolled up the sleeves for a more casual look and to display the contrast. The shirt's sleeves appear to reach just below the elbow when rolled up, fitting the description of being full sleeves if they were unrolled.

The model is described as wearing size M in t-shirts, and his height is listed as 6 feet, with a shoulder span of 18 inches, which generally falls into the medium or standard range for men's sizing in many regions. These measurements are provided to help potential buyers gauge how the shirt might fit them based on the appearance on the model. His slim build and the tailored fit of the shirt accentuate the slim-fitting aspect of the design.

Regarding wash care, the instructions outline that the shirt should be machine washed in cold water at 30 degrees Celsius and that dark colors should be washed separately. This is a standard precaution to prevent dye transfer from darker materials to lighter ones during the washing process. It also recommends not bleaching the shirt, tumbling it dry on low, and using a warm iron, which are commonly suggested for cotton garments to maintain their appearance and quality over time.

Lastly, it is suggested that the shirt pairs well with formal trousers and leather shoes, indicating that it is suitable for professional environments, though the rolled-up sleeves and the pattern can lend it a business-casual feel as well. Overall, the shirt seems like a versatile piece that can transition from office wear to a more relaxed setting.
