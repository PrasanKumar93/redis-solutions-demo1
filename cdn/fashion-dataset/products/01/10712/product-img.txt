Composition:
- The t-shirt is made of 100% cotton, which suggests that it's likely to be soft to the touch, breathable, and comfortable for all-day wear.
- The neckline is round and ribbed, featuring a grey fabric tape on the inseam which might reinforce the structure and offer a subtle contrasting detail.
- Short sleeves make it suitable for warmer weather or can be layered under jackets or cardigans in cooler temperatures.

Design and Style:
- The t-shirt displays a graphic print with large dotted figures resembling the number "10" prominently on the front. The polka dots within the number add a playful and sporty look.
- There are additional appliqué details on the upper right portion of the chest, featuring what appear to be letter patches with a collegiate or varsity jacket style. This contributes to the overall sporty and youthful aesthetic of the tee.
- The color blue is considered versatile and can be easily matched with various bottoms and accessories.
- The branding "the athletic" is subtly showcased on the neckline tape, providing a hint of the brand identity.

Fitting:
- The product description states a "comfort" fit, which hints that the t-shirt is designed to be loose-fitting rather than form-fitting. This suggests a relaxed cut that might provide ease of movement and a laid-back look.

Wash Care:
