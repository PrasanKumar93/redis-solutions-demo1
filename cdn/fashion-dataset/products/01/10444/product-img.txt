The image depicts a male model showcasing an aqua blue and white plaid shirt with black and grey accents. Based on the provided product details, this shirt is composed of 100% cotton, which suggests breathability and comfort. The shirt features full sleeves with a buttoned placket and what appears to be white stitch detailing, contributing to a clean and tailored finish. The shirt has a regular fit, which generally means it's not too tight or too loose, providing a balance between comfort and a well-defined silhouette.

The two patch pockets on the chest add functional details as well as a laid-back style to the design. There's an embroidered brand logo on the left chest pocket that is subtle and aligns with the casual yet stylish intent of the shirt. The curved hemline enhances the informal nature of this shirt and suggests versatility in wearing it; it could be tucked into lower garments or left out.

For care, it is recommended to be machine washed cold, which helps in maintaining the fabric's quality and color. It should not be tumble dried or dried in direct sunlight, which indicates the material may be prone to shrinkage or fading if not cared for properly. The garment should be turned inside out before drying, likely to protect the exterior surface and any decorative elements like the embroidered logo. Ironing should be done warm and avoiding any printed areas to prevent damage.

As a fashion item, this shirt can be paired with various bottoms, such as jeans or chinos, and is suggested to be worn with slip-on shoes for a casual, effortless look. The model in the image is wearing size M and has the following measurements: height of 6 feet and shoulder width of 19 inches, which can give potential buyers a reference for how the shirt might fit on a similarly built person. The model is styled with the sleeves neatly rolled up to mid-forearm, further contributing to the shirt's easygoing style suitability for casual outings or hanging out with friends.
