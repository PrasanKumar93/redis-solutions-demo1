This is a men's check shirt featuring a combination of green, black, red, and white colors. The shirt is made from 100% cotton, indicating that it should be comfortable to wear and breathable, suitable for various seasons but especially favorable in warmer climates due to cotton's ability to absorb moisture and ventilate.

The shirt has a classic design with a tipped collar and a full front button placket. It has full-length sleeves, which can also be worn rolled up thanks to the mid-sleeve buttoned flap, adding a versatile element to the style that allows it to transition from a more formal to a casual look. The sleeves end in cuffs, which also appear to be buttoned. 

There is a single chest pocket on the left side, adorned with a buttoned flap and a brand badge, contributing to the shirt's semi-formal appearance. The shirt has a curved hemline, which is a common feature that helps the shirt look more tailored and can be attractively worn untucked.

The fitting is described as 'comfort,' which likely means the shirt is not too tight or too loose, providing a relaxed fit that doesn't constrain movement. 

For care, the shirt requires some attention: it should be hand washed in cold water with a mild detergent, which will help maintain its color and shape. Dark colors should be washed separately to avoid dye transfer. The shirt should not be bleached, wrung, or tumble dried, which could damage the fabric or alter its size. Instead, it should be flat dried in the shade to prevent color fading from sun exposure. Ironing should be mild and should avoid prints, embellishments, or embroidery to preserve the shirt's details.

Based on the provided model statistics, the model is 6 feet tall with 18-inch shoulders, wearing size M. This suggests that the shirt has a regular fit for a man of an average to slightly above-average height and build.

This check shirt can be paired with jeans and leather shoes for a smart-casual look, suitable for semi-formal events or everyday wear. The fabric and care instructions suggest itâ€™s a quality piece that requires some maintenance to keep it in good shape. Overall, the shirt's traditional checked pattern and versatile style make it a practical addition to a modern wardrobe.
