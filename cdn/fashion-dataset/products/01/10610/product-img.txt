The image displays a man wearing a turquoise green pique polo neck t-shirt. From the provided product details and the visible features in the image, here's a comprehensive analysis of the product:

1. **Material**: The t-shirt is made of 100% cotton, which suggests it is likely to be breathable, comfortable, and suitable for warm weather. Cotton is also a durable material that should hold up well with regular wear and washing.

2. **Design & Style**: The polo t-shirt features a ribbed collar and contrast ribbed sleeve hems, which add a sporty yet stylish touch. The contrasting colors in the sleeve hems complement the main color of the t-shirt, giving it a subtle but attractive accent.

3. **Collar Detailing**: There's tape detailing on the inseam of the collar, which is not visible in the image. This detail is usually added for both aesthetic and functional purposes, potentially providing reinforcement along the neckline.

4. **Placket & Buttons**: The t-shirt has a buttoned chest placket. While the number of buttons is not specified in the product details nor fully visible in the image, plackets are typically a standard feature on polo shirts that add functionality and style.

5. **Embroidery & Applique**: The t-shirt features an embroidered brand name on the left chest and another branding detail on the right sleeve. Although the brand is not identified due to adherence to guidelines regarding not revealing real people or brand identities, these details signify brand presence and add value to the garment. There's also mention of a brand tab appliqued on the left hem, which is partly visible in the image.

6. **Back Detailing**: The description mentions a "huge applique and print combo on the back," which is not visible in the image. This detailing could be a significant factor for buyers looking for unique elements or brand visibility from different angles.

7. **Hem Style**: The t-shirt has vented hems, which can provide greater freedom of movement and can add to the comfort factor when seated, as they prevent the shirt from pulling tight across the hips.

8. **Color**: The turquoise green color is bright and visually appealing, making it suitable for casual wear and easy to pair with various bottoms like jeans, shorts, or chinos.

9. **Fit**: Based on the image, the t-shirt appears to have a regular fit, which should be suitable for a broad range of body types. It looks neither too tight nor too loose on the model, offering a balanced silhouette.

10. **Overall Impression**: The product combines comfort, style, and brand-focused design, making it an attractive choice for consumers interested in casual yet fashionable apparel.

Overall, the t-shirt seems to be a well-designed casual garment with branding elements that could appeal to those who are loyal to the brand or enjoy displaying brand affiliation through their clothing.
