The product depicted in the image is a wristwatch by the brand Esprit, specifically a model from their Velocit Chrono line. This is an analog watch, which suggests that it displays the time via moving hands rather than a digital display. From the detailed image, the following features and design elements of the watch can be outlined:

1. Design Aesthetics: The watch has a classic yet contemporary design that blends traditional watch aesthetics with modern elements. It features a combination of a textured white dial with contrasting black and silver elements. 

2. Dial: The white dial has a textured pattern, which adds depth and a premium feel. It features three sub-dials likely indicating a chronograph function that can be used as a stopwatch. There is a date window at the 3 o'clock position, which is a convenient feature for everyday use.

3. Watch Case: The case looks robust with a metallic finish, possibly stainless steel, offering a sleek and durable design. There appears to be a tachymeter scale on the bezel, which is a common chronograph feature used to measure speed over a known distance.

4. Hour Markers and Hands: The watch has bold hour markers with numerical indicators for five-minute increments on the bezel. The hands and hour markers seem to be treated with a luminescent coating for visibility in low-light conditions.

5. Watch Band: The band is a metallic bracelet with a folding clasp, matching the material and finish of the watch case. The band's links are sizable, a characteristic of a watch designed for a secure and comfortable fit.

6. Chronicles and Adjustments: The side of the case features push-buttons for operating the chronograph function and a central crown for setting the time and date. The position and style of these elements are in keeping with the traditional chronograph wristwatch design.

7. Branding: The brand's name "ESPRIT" and the word "CHRONOGRAPH" are prominently displayed below the 12 o'clock mark, indicating the functionality of the watch.

8. Water Resistance: There's an indication that the watch might be water-resistant ("10 BAR"), which implies it can withstand pressures equivalent to 100 meters (or 330 feet) underwater.

Overall, this Esprit Velocit Chrono watch looks like a functional, stylish timepiece suitable for both formal and casual occasions. Its design suggests a marriage of function and style, making it an accessory that could appeal to individuals who appreciate a classic watch aesthetic with modern performance features.
