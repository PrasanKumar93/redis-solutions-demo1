The image presents a dark blue denim skirt with a frontal zip and button closure. The skirt features belt loops around the waistband, which host a decorative floral cotton fabric belt. This belt is tied in a bow and showcases a design with pink floral patterns on a light colored background, which adds a colorful and playful touch to the garment.

There are visible pockets on the sides, following a traditional five-pocket design commonly found in denim clothing. This includes the small inner pocket nested within the right side pocket, which is characteristic of jeans and similar denim garments. Additionally, there are two pockets on the back side of the skirt.

The skirt's hem appears to be finished with a clean line stitch, which is typical for denim skirts, adding to their durability and keeping the fabric from fraying. The color of the denim is dark with what seems to be a slight fade effect, indicative of a wash treatment that creates a naturally worn look.

In terms of care, as stated in the product description, the skirt should be machine washed in cold water with similar colors and should be handled delicately. There is an emphasis on avoiding bleach and ironing directly on any print or embellishment. It's also recommended to tumble dry it on a low setting or lay it flat to dry and to use a warm iron if needed, implying the skirt can stand regular ironing as long as the floral belt and any prints are avoided.

The skirt is described as having a 'regular' fit, which usually implies it's neither too tight nor too loose, ensuring comfort for the wearer.

Overall, this denim skirt seems to be designed for children, as suggested by the style and the final statement about dressing "your little girl" in it. Its aesthetic, with the added playful belt, is directed towards a youthful audience. It would pair well with a variety of tops and sandals, making it a flexible piece for a child's wardrobe for casual wear.
