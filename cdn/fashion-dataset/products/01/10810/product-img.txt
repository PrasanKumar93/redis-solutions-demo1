Based on the information provided and the image, I will provide a comprehensive analysis of the product:

1. **Composition**: The shirt is described as light blue, made of 100% cotton. Cotton is known for its breathability and comfort, especially in warm climates, making it suitable for all-day wear. The image confirms the light blue color and gives an impression of a soft, natural fabric.

2. **Design Features**: 
   - **Sleeves**: The shirt features full arm cuff sleeves with a mid-sleeve buttoned flap, suggesting that the sleeves can be secured when rolled up. This adds to the versatile styling of the shirt, allowing it to be worn in a more casual or relaxed manner, as seen in the image where the model has the sleeves rolled up.
   - **Collar**: The tipped collar is a classic design, and the image shows a neat and structured collar, contributing to a semi-formal look.
   - **Buttoned Placket**: A full front buttoned placket is visible in the image, aligning with the description. It appears to be neatly done with no visible puckering.
   - **Stitch Detailing**: While the image doesn't allow a close-up view of the stitch detailing along the curved hem, such details typically add refinement to a garment.
   - **Contrast Fabric**: The white and blue striped fabric inseam on the collar adds a subtle contrast detail, which is not visible in the image provided, but would be a nice hidden feature when the collar is lifted.
   - **Branding**: Branding can be seen on the left chest as mentioned in the description, confirming the presence of the brand's identity. 

3. **Fitting**: The fitting is described as "comfort," which typically means a relaxed fit that's not too tight or too loose. The image shows the shirt fitting the model well without appearing too snug, which reflects the comfort fit.

4. **Wash Care**: The shirt requires careful handling, such as hand wash in cold water and using mild detergent, washing dark colors separately, avoiding bleach, wringing, or tumble drying. The care suggests that the shirt is susceptible to damage if not treated correctly, which is typical for garments made from 100% cotton.

5. **Styling**: The description suggests styling this shirt with jeans and sports shoes for a semi-formal look. The image depicts the model in the suggested manner, pairing the shirt with dark trousers, which complement the light blue color well.
