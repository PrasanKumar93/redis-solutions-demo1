The product in question is a black round-neck t-shirt made by Puma. The t-shirt is crafted from 100% cotton, and this composition suggests that it should offer breathable comfort to the wearer, as cotton is known for its softness and natural breathability.

The t-shirt is tailored with a slim fit design, which typically means it is designed to closely fit the body, providing a streamlined and modern silhouette that is often preferred in contemporary casual fashion. Slim fit garments are usually snugger at the chest and waist.

For the wash care, the t-shirt requires a gentle machine wash with similar colors in cool water at 30 degrees Celsius. These instructions indicate that the garment should be handled with care to maintain its color and shape. Customers are cautioned against bleaching, tumble drying, and dry cleaning, as these processes could potentially damage the fabric or the print. Warm ironing is permitted, which suggests that the print can withstand heat to a certain degree, but care should probably be taken to avoid direct ironing over the logo to prevent any damage.

The t-shirt has aesthetic detailing that includes the Puma brand name printed across the chest with a multi-hued line design that adds a touch of glam and style. The Puma Leaping Cat logo, a signature feature for the brand, is also noticeable below the nape of the neck at the back of the t-shirt.

The product description recommends teaming the t-shirt with white or denim shorts and canvas shoes for a casual and stylish look. This fashion advice is helpful for customers who may want guidance on how to style the piece.
