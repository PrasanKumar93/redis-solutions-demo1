The product depicted in the image is a pair of washed light blue skinny jeans. Based on the provided product details, here is a comprehensive analysis:

1. Composition and Material:
   - The jeans are made of a mixture of 98% cotton and 2% spandex, which suggests that they provide the natural comfort and breathability of cotton, while the spandex allows for a slight stretch, enhancing the fit and making them more comfortable to move in.

2. Design Features:
   - The jeans have a low-rise waist, which is a style where the waistband sits below the natural waistline.
   - They have a skinny fit, meaning they are designed to be tight-fitting through the hips down to the ankles.
   - The front features two insert pockets, which are practical elements commonly found in jeans.
   - On the back, there are two patch pockets with thread detailing, which adds to the jeans' aesthetic and functionality.
   - There is a brand patch appliqued on the waistband at the back, a common branding method for denim.
   - Closure is provided by a metal zipper and button, standard for jeans and helps ensure a secure fit.

3. Care Instructions:
   - Machine wash cold water: This suggests that the jeans should be washed at a low temperature to preserve the fabric and color.
   - Do not tumble dry: This indicates that tumble drying may damage the material or cause it to shrink.
   - Turn inside out before drying: This practice helps in reducing color fade and protects the outer surface.
   - Don’t dry in direct sunlight: Exposing the jeans to direct sunlight can cause the color to fade more quickly.
   - Use warm iron: This indicates that ironing is safe but should be done with caution regarding the temperature.
   - Do not iron on print: This is a standard warning to prevent damage to any prints or embellishments on the fabric.

4. Styling Suggestion:

5. Model Statistics for Reference:
   - A reference is provided for the model wearing the jeans: wearing jeans of length 41.5” with a height of 6’ and a waist of 32”. This could help potential buyers gauge how the jeans may fit someone of a similar build.
