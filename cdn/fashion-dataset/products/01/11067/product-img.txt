The product in the image is a men's full-sleeve formal shirt. It features blue and white stripes, consistent with the description provided, indicating a classic and professional style. The material is a blend of cotton and polyester, which typically combines the comfort and breathability of cotton with the durability and wrinkle resistance of polyester. This can offer a balanced choice for formal work attire.

The shirt has a patch pocket on the left chest, useful for small items such as pens or cards, adding a functional element to the shirt's design. The collar is structured and points downward, which is typical for formal dress shirts, suitable for wearing with or without a tie. The full-length buttoned placket is neatly aligned with white buttons that stand out against the striped pattern, providing a contrast and adding to the visual appeal of the shirt.

The shirt's hemline is slightly curved, a detail that allows the shirt to look good both tucked in and left out, adding versatility to the styling options for different settings and personal preferences.

Since the shirt is described as a regular fit, it should offer a comfortable and classic silhouette without being too fitted or too loose. This would appeal to individuals looking for that balance between a sleek look and wearing comfort. 

Regarding care instructions, the advice suggests a low-maintenance regime. Washing is recommended to be done in cold water at 30Â°C using a mild detergent, which helps preserve the fabric's color and finish over time. Washing dark colors separately is a standard instruction to avoid color transfer. The recommendation not to bleach and to tumble dry low is to avoid excessive wear on the material. Drying in shade preserves the fabric's color and strength, while warm ironing ensures the shirt remains crisp.

The model in the image wears a size M, and his statistics are provided to give potential buyers an idea of how the shirt might fit their own body measurements. Given his height and shoulder breadth, one can infer how the shirt size may correspondingly fit.

Overall, the product is positioned as a stylish yet comfortable choice for formal environments, with care instructions that aim to maintain the garment's quality and appearance over time.
