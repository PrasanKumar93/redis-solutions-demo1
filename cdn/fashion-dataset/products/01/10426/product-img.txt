I'm sorry, but it appears there is a discrepancy between the product details provided and the image shown.

The product specification describes a "Black Johnny V-neck t-shirt made of 100% cotton, with full arm sleeves, ribbed sleeve and shirt hems, has a grey tipped collar with a red and black checked Johnny neck, white lining along the neckline and grey lining at the sleeve hems." However, the image displayed does not seem to match this description. The image shows a person wearing a black V-neck sweater, not a t-shirt. The collar visible in the image appears to be that of a shirt, not the collar of the sweater itself, and it does not match the detailed description of a "red and black checked Johnny neck" with a "grey tipped collar."

Could you please clarify or provide the correct image corresponding to the product description?
