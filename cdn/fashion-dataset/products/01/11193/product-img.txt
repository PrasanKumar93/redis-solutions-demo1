The product in the image is a Carrera brand wristwatch with a distinctive square dial design. Below are the key features which can be concluded from the product details provided and the image:

1. **Brand Legacy**: The Carrera brand is noted as having over 50 years of experience in the watchmaking industry, signifying a history of craftsmanship and likely a reputation for quality.

2. **Design Aesthetics**: The watch has a square dial which stands out in contrast to more traditional round dials. Such a shape can be considered modern and may appeal to those seeking a watch with a contemporary look.

3. **Dial Appearance**: The dial is described as 'busy,' which suggests it has multiple features or intricate designs. In the image, we can see Roman numerals at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock positions, with stick indices for the other hours. The Carrera logo is prominently displayed on the dial.

4. **Material and Build Quality**: The case is made of stainless steel which provides both durability and a sleek look. The black leather strap complements the stainless steel case for a sophisticated appearance and is inscribed with the brand on the inner side. The bezel is also made of stainless steel, which adds to the durability and style.

5. **Clasp Mechanism**: The clasp is a combination of a Tang and butterfly metallic clasp with brand inscription, which indicates a focus on security and brand detailing.

6. **Size Specifications**: The case diameter is 39 mm, and thickness is 9 mm, a size that should fit comfortably on a variety of wrist sizes and is in line with contemporary style preferences for timepieces.

7. **Water Resistance**: One of its impressive features is the 100-meter water resistance, which means it is suitable for swimming and snorkeling, but not deep-sea diving despite the term "scuba diving" mentioned in the product description.

8. **Functionality**: From the image, the watch clearly shows a metallic crown that can be used to adjust time, date, or day, although specific date or day complications are not visible in the image. The watch hands are also metallic, which provides a contrast with the white dial for easy readability.

9. **Color Scheme and Style**: The mainly monochrome color scheme with the black strap, black dial numerals, and hands on a white backdrop creates a classic and versatile look that could be easily paired with various fashion choices, suitably matching the "urban wear" designation.

10. **Inscriptions**: The presence of brand inscriptions on the clasp and inner side of the strap is a testament to the brand's attention to detail and can also act as a mark of authenticity for the watch.

11. **Usage**: Given its style and features, the watch seems tailored for everyday wear as well as for formal occasions, reflecting a balance between functionality and fashion.

Overall, the watch presented in the image appears to be a well-designed product with useful features and a strong emphasis on style and durability, catering to those who value both functionality and aesthetics in a timepiece.
