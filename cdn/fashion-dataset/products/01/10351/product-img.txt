The product depicted in the image is a long skirt for women. Here's a comprehensive analysis of it based on the provided product details and the image:

**Design and Composition:**
- The skirt has a grey color base with black and blue checks which gives it a classic and versatile look. Checks are a timeless pattern that can be styled in various ways.
- It is composed of 70% viscose and 30% lana wool. Viscose is a semi-synthetic type of rayon fabric made from wood pulp that is used as a silk substitute, as it has a similar drape and smooth feel. Lana wool is likely a translation error or a specific brand designation for wool, generally meaning wool in several languages. This composition suggests a blend offering warmth from the wool and a smooth texture from the viscose.
- The skirt is lined with 100% acetate, which is a common lining fabric due to its smooth texture that allows for easy layering over other clothing without bunching up.

**Fit and Closure:**
- It features a comfortable waist which implies that the skirt is designed for a comfortable fit around the waist area, perhaps with an elasticized or forgiving waistband.
- It has a zippered and button closure on the right side, allowing the wearer to put it on and take it off easily.

**Care Instructions:**
- It requires delicate machine wash at 30 degrees with a mild detergent which is typical for preserving the quality of materials like viscose and wool and maintaining the integrity of the skirt.
- The instructions advise against dry cleaning, tumble drying, wringing, scrubbing, or bleaching, all of which could damage the fabric.
- The skirt should be dried flat in shade which helps to prevent stretching or misshaping the garment.
- A warm iron can be used, but direct ironing on print or embroidery (if applicable) should be avoided to prevent damage.

**Styling Tips:**
- The product description suggests this skirt can be worn casually with heeled sandals and a fancy top, or dressed up for formal occasions with a suitable top and jacket. This versatility makes it a practical addition to a wardrobe.
- The model's statistics are provided for reference, suggesting a size M for someone with a height of 5.8" and a waist of 26". This can give customers an idea of fit and length.

**Image Analysis:**
