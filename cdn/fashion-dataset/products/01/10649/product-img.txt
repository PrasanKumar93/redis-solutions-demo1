   - **Placket:** The front buttoned placket is visible with what appears to be checked fabric lining on the inside, which could add a pop of detail when the shirt is partially unbuttoned.
   - **Pocket:** There is a pocket on the left chest area. It features checked piping along its edge, adding a touch of pattern without overwhelming the shirt's simple aesthetic.
   - **Graphics:** A graphic print is present on the right chest area, which looks like a crest or emblem design adding to the shirt's character. The product description mentions graphics on the back as well, but since the back isn't visible in the image, these cannot be analyzed.
