7. **Readability**: With a lack of numbers or prominent hour markers, the watch face focuses on simplicity. Some individuals might find the absence of these elements makes the watch harder to read at a glance.

8. **Unique Identifier**: The bottom part of the watch face includes a series of alphanumeric characters that could be a unique identifier or model number for the watch. This detail could be helpful for warranty purposes or for identifying the specific model of the watch.
