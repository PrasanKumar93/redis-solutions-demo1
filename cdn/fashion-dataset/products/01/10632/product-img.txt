Based on the product details provided and the image, the product is a shoe that incorporates various materials and design elements aimed at providing both comfort and durability.

Upper:
- The upper part of the shoe is made from synthetic leather and suede which can be observed in the image as the main body of the shoe. This combination of materials suggests a balance between durability and a premium look.
- There is a suede toe box visible at the front of the shoe that likely provides extra durability in the high-wear area of the toe.
- The shoe features two Velcro straps that serve as its closure system, which can be seen fastened over the midfoot. These straps pass through metallic eyelets, which are not completely visible in the image, but they would likely enhance the shoe’s fit and give it a more secure feel.
- A suede overlay can be seen wrapping around the heel cup area, adding to the shoe’s support and style.

Midsole:
- The product description notes a soft cushioned footbed, which is not directly visible but presumed to be inside the shoe, designed for comfort.
- It mentions a full-length EVA midsole which is known for lightweight cushioning and longevity. The midsole appears to have a distinct, slightly mottled textural design, which might be visible due to the style or wear indication.

Outsole:
- The midsole is stitched to the outsole, which is a method used to increase the lifespan of the shoe. This can sometimes be observed as a stitching pattern around the perimeter of the outsole, but it is not distinctly visible in the provided image.
- The outsole is described as being made from textured durable rubber. The image shows the outsole's side, and while the bottom texture can't be seen, the side seems to show evidence of the textured design. Such texturing would enhance grip and traction.

In terms of style, the shoe displays a somewhat classic design that might appeal to those looking for a casual shoe with a sporty aesthetic due to its relatively thick sole and the prominent Velcro straps. The color scheme is muted, with earth tones dominating, and there is a contrast between the suede and synthetic leather materials that could make it versatile enough to pair with various casual outfits.

Overall, the shoe seems to have been designed with a focus on combining a traditional style with materials and construction methods aimed at providing comfort and enhancing durability.
