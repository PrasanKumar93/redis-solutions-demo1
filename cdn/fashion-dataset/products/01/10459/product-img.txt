1. Design & Features: 
   - The t-shirt is fuschia pink in color, which is a vibrant shade that stands out and is attractive to the eye.
   - It is designed with a round neckline that appears to fit snugly, which is typical for casual wear.
   - There is ribbed detailing along the collar, which adds texture to the design and helps in retaining the shape of the neckline.
   - Blue thread detailing is mentioned in the product details but is not distinctly visible in the image. Such detailing could add a subtle contrast and enhance the overall look.
   - There is a distressed look print on the front of the t-shirt featuring what seems to be a graphic of robotic figures and text related to animation and graphics. This indicates a theme that may appeal to consumers interested in robotics, technology, or graphic art.

2. Material:
   - The t-shirt is made of 100% cotton, which suggests it is breathable and comfortable to wear, particularly in warmer climates or for everyday use.
   - Cotton is also known for its softness and durability, making it a standard choice for casual clothing.

3. Fit:
   - According to the product details, the t-shirt has a regular fit which is corroborated by the image. This implies that it is designed to be neither too tight nor too loose, fitting comfortably for a range of body types.
   - The model in the image wears size M, and with his given height of 6 feet and shoulder width of 19 inches, the t-shirt appears to fit well, indicating true sizing.

4. Care Instructions:
   - The washing care involves machine washing cold, which is aimed to preserve the fabric and print quality.
   - It is advised not to tumble dry, which can prevent shrinkage and maintain the shape of the t-shirt.
   - Turning the t-shirt inside out before drying is recommended, likely to protect the print from fading or damage.
   - A warm iron can be used, which is suitable for cotton material, but direct ironing on the print is discouraged to avoid ruining the graphic.
