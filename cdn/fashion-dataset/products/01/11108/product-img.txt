The product depicted in the image is a white full-sleeved shirt with black stripes. The material composition is 70% polyester and 30% cotton, which can be advantageous for durability and reduced wrinkling while still having some of the comfort and breathability of cotton.

The shirt features a patch pocket on the left chest, a classic element in many formal shirts. The full-length button placket adds to the formal style, and is consistent with the description provided in the product details.

The fitting of the shirt is described as "regular," which suggests it isn't tailored to a slim or relaxed fit but rather is intended to suit the average body type without being overly form-fitting or loose. This is a popular choice for daily office wear and can accommodate a wide range of body types comfortably.

The wash care instructions provided for the shirt are quite typical for garments blending polyester and cotton. Customers are advised to machine or hand wash the shirt in cold water at 30Â°C with a mild detergent, which is useful for maintaining the color and shape of the fabric. Washing dark colors separately is standard advice to prevent dye transfer to lighter colored garments. Not using bleach is important as it can degrade the fabric and ruin the stripes. Tumble drying on low and drying in shade will help in preserving the fabric's integrity and preventing shrinkage. Lastly, warm ironing is suitable for a shirt of this material mix to keep it crisp without damaging the fibers.

The product description indicates the shirt is from Indigo Nation and encourages pairing it with formal trousers and leather shoes for a smart office look. The "fresh and crisp" look it mentions suggests that the shirt is designed to maintain a neat appearance during long hours of wear.

Regarding the model statistics, the model shown wears size M in t-shirts and size 40 in shirts, with a height of 6 feet and shoulder width of 18 inches. This information is helpful for potential customers to gauge the shirt's fit on their own body type.

Overall, the product appears to be a practical, versatile garment that is marketed as a way to add some style to the usual formal office attire. The clean and professional appearance of the shirt in the accompanying image aligns with the brand's narrative of making formal wear more interesting while still maintaining an appropriate look for work settings.
