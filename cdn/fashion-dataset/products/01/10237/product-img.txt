3. **Strap**: It comes with a leather strap featuring a tang clasp, which suggests comfort and a classic look that can easily transition from casual to formal wear.

7. **Time Reset**: The time can be reset using a screw, likely situated on the side of the case.

8. **Back Case**: The watch has a solid case back which enhances its durability and could also contribute to its water resistance.

9. **Water Resistance**: The watch is water-resistant up to 50 meters, making it suitable for swimming but not for diving. This water resistance feature adds to the watchâ€™s utility, making it more versatile for everyday use.

10. **Product Identification Number**: It appears there's a number (which looks like "022011") at the bottom of the watch face, possibly a model or serial number relating to this specific design or production run.
