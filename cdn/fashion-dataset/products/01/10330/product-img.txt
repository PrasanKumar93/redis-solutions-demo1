The image shows a black leather belt featuring a crocodile texture, which gives the item a stylish and sophisticated appearance. The belt employs a tang clasp, which is a traditional buckle style that involves inserting the beltâ€™s pin into one of the holes along the belt to secure it at a desired fit. The presence of multiple holes ensures that the wearer can adjust the belt to their specific waist size, offering a customizable and comfortable fit.

The belt includes stitch detailing in a contrasting color along the edges, which not only serves as a design element but also reinforces the edges for added durability. The craftsmanship of the stitching suggests attention to detail in the belt's construction.

A brand logo is said to be embossed on the tail, but it's not visible in this picture, which focuses specifically on the buckle area and a portion of the belt length, leaving the tail end out of view. The buckle appears shiny, likely made of a polished metal, and possibly designed to contrast with the black leather for a more striking effect.

The provided length of 87 cm suggests that this belt is sized for individuals within a certain waist measurement range, with the exact fitting depending on the number of holes and their spacing. The product details mention care instructions for maintaining the belt, including using a brass polisher for the buckle, indicating it may contain brass elements, and a leather conditioner for preserving the leather material.

Overall, this belt appears to be a high-quality accessory that combines functionality with fashion, suitable for various styles ranging from casual to business attire. The crocodile texture offers an upscale touch, making it a potentially appealing choice for those looking to enhance their outfit with a classic yet distinctive piece.
