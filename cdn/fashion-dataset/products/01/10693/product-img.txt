1. **Material Composition**: The t-shirt is made of 100% cotton, which suggests it is breathable, soft and should be comfortable for children to wear. The natural fibers of cotton are gentle on the skin, making it a suitable choice for kids' clothing, especially for those with sensitive skin.

The front of the t-shirt has a graphic print with the word "CUTE" repeated in a descending pattern and followed by "to be Born," which adds a playful and characterful element to the design. The use of yellow lettering for the print creates a pleasant contrast with the purple fabric.

4. **Brand and Collection**: A badge indicating the collection, "Bee Born," is placed on the left waist area of the t-shirt. This branding element demonstrates the t-shirtâ€™s association with a specific collection, which could be part of a thematic or seasonal release by the manufacturers.
