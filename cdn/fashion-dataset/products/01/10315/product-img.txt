The product in the image is an Esprit Rough Chic analog wristwatch which combines traditional design elements with a modern aesthetic. Here are the details based on the information provided and the image:

- **Design Aesthetics**: The watch has a classic and contemporary look. It features a redgold polished stainless steel case that provides durability as well as an added touch of style. The white strap appears to be made of leather, intertwined with redgold polished stainless steel, offering a unique and fashionable appearance. The tang clasp is secure and includes branding, likely ensuring authenticity and brand recognition.

- **Case and Dial**: The case diameter is specified as 22 mm with a thickness of 11 mm, making it relatively dainty and perhaps better suited for smaller wrists. The dial shape is rectangular, which can be seen as a distinctive design choice versus the more common round dials. The dial is white with a clean, minimalist design featuring zircon crystal indices at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock positions and polished hands that provide a sophisticated finish. The Esprit branding is visible on the dial, confirming the brand identity.

- **Movement and Functionality**: The watch uses quartz movement for timekeeping, known for precision and low maintenance. A screw is mentioned for resetting the time, which may indicate the presence of a crown typically used to adjust the time.

- **Durability Factors**: It has a durable, scratch-resistant mineral crystal glass, protecting the dial from wear and tear. A solid case back is noted, which could contribute to the watch’s structural integrity and longevity. 

- **Water Resistance**: The watch's water resistance up to 30 meters suggests that it is safe to wear while performing tasks like washing hands or a car, but it is not suitable for swimming or diving.

- **Image Observation**: In the image, the watch appears new and in pristine condition, perfect for display or e-commerce listing. The combination of the redgold and white strap colors give it a versatile appeal that could complement various outfits.

Overall, based on the product details and the image, this Esprit wristwatch appears to be a fashion-focused timepiece that offers an elegant blend of traditional and modern design elements. It’s styled to cater to those looking for a distinctive yet subtle accessory. The watch is suitable for everyday wear and potentially special occasions, given its elegant design and water-resistant properties. However, potential buyers should consider the case size to ensure that it meets their preference for watch scale and wrist fit.
