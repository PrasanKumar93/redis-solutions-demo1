The product displayed in the image is a white full-sleeved shirt with dark green vertical stripes. Based on the provided product details, the shirt is made of a blend of 60% polyester and 40% cotton, which suggests a balance between durability and comfort. The shirt features a patch pocket on the left chest and is designed with a full front buttoned placket, which is a classic feature of formal shirts.

The fitting of the shirt is described as "Regular," implying it should provide a standard fit that is not too tight or too loose on the body. Regular fit typically allows for a comfortable range of movement and is suitable for various body types.

The image shows the shirt paired with black formal trousers and a black belt, presenting a professional look that aligns with the product's positioning as suitable for formal occasions. The stripes on the shirt add a touch of detail that keeps the style interesting and can potentially elongate the appearance of the torso due to their vertical orientation.

The care instructions are detailed and emphasize maintaining the quality of the garment. They recommend hand or machine washing in cold water with mild detergent, washing dark colors separately, avoiding bleach, tumble drying on a low setting, drying in shade, and ironing with a warm iron. These care suggestions are typical for preserving the integrity and appearance of mixed fabric garments like this one.

The product description suggests versatility in its use, stating that it can be worn for formal occasions at the office or dressed down with jeans for casual outings with friends. This makes it a flexible addition to a wardrobe.

The "model statistics" given indicate that the model wears size 40 in shirts, is 6 feet tall, and has a shoulder width of 18 inches. This information can help potential customers judge the fit of the shirt based on their own measurements.

In the image, the shirt appears well-fitted on the model, with the sleeves ending at the wrist and no apparent pulling of the fabric across the chest or shoulders, which further demonstrate the regular fit. The collar is structured and sits well under the model's face, which is pleasant for a formal style shirt.

The presentation of the product is effective, showcasing the shirt clearly with good lighting and a simple pose that allows customers to see the overall fit and style. The contrast of the stripes against the white shirt, along with the pairing with black trousers, creates a professional and clean appearance that can appeal to those looking for a versatile formal shirt.
