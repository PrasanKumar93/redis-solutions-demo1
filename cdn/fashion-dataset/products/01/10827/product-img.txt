The product depicted in the image is a white round neck t-shirt made of 100% cotton. It features short sleeves and has a branding element located on the left sleeve, which is partially visible in the image. On the chest of the t-shirt, there's a graphic print that appears to contain some imagery and text, but the specific details of the graphic are not entirely clear from this distance.

Regarding the fitting of the t-shirt, the product details mention it is designed for comfort, which suggests it has a relaxed fit that isn't too tight or restrictive. This fit is confirmed by the image, in which the t-shirt appears to drape comfortably on the model without being overly tight. The model has been stated to be wearing size M, and based on his statistics with a height of 6 feet and shoulder breadth of 18 inches, the t-shirt seems to fit well, showcasing the intended comfortable fit.

For wash care instructions, the product requires hand washing in cold water using a mild detergent, and owners need to wash dark colours separately. It should not be bleached, wrung, or tumble dried and instead should be flat dried in the shade. If ironing is needed, it should be done mildly, and the iron should not be applied to the print or any other embellishments or embroidery. These care instructions underscore the need to treat the cotton fabric gently to maintain its look and feel.

Taking a closer look at the image, the t-shirt's cotton fabric appears to have a smooth finish, which would contribute to the comfort and breathability of the garment. The light color and casual style suggest the t-shirt is well-suited for casual wear, and based on the product description, it can be styled with jeans and suede shoes or shorts and sandals, which would make for versatile outfit options.

Overall, based on the image and the provided product details, this t-shirt seems to be a casual and comfortable piece of clothing with specific care instructions to preserve its quality. The graphic print adds a distinctive touch to the otherwise classic white tee, making it suitable for those who enjoy graphic apparel as part of their casual wardrobe.
