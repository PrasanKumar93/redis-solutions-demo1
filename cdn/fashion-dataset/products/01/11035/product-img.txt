The product in the image is a women's blouson-style shirt featuring a green and purple checkered pattern with navy blue accents. The shirt is tailored with a collar and has short elasticated sleeves that enhance its casual look. The sleeves have a slight puff due to the elastic which adds to the feminine style of the garment. Additionally, the shirt includes a tie-up belt at the waist, which can be adjusted to define the waistline as per the wearer's preference.

The shirt's fabric composition is 100% cotton, making it a comfortable choice for everyday wear, particularly in warmer climates due to cotton's breathability. Its pattern and color combination give it a playful and trendy appearance that can be quite versatile for various casual occasions.

In terms of the fitting, the product is described as having a regular fit, which implies it is not too tight or too loose and should accommodate the body comfortably without restricting movement.

The wash care instructions suggest that the shirt can be washed either by hand or in a machine, with mild detergent, which is typical for a cotton garment. It is advised to avoid bleaching and wringing the shirt to maintain its shape. Drying in the shade is recommended to prevent any color fading due to exposure to direct sunlight, and a medium iron can be used to eliminate wrinkles and keep the shirt looking crisp.

The product description ends by suggesting a fashion ensemble with this shirt, pairing it with leggings and ballerina flats that would result in a cute and neat look. The model in the image provides consumers with a visual representation, wearing a size M with a height of 5'7", and the stated chest and waist measurements help potential buyers gauge the fit of the shirt for themselves.

From the image, the shirt looks well-fitted on the model, highlighting the attributes mentioned in the product detailsâ€”its checkered design, fitting, and belted waist are clearly visible. It stands out against the plain background, which is beneficial for an e-commerce setting because it allows potential customers to focus on the product without any distractions.
