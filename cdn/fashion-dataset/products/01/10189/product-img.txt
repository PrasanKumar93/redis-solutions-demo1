The product depicted in the image is a royal blue full sleeves shirt with white stripes. The shirt is made of 100% cotton, which suggests it is likely to be soft, comfortable, and breathable. These are desirable qualities for both formal and casual wear, potentially contributing to the comfort of the wearer throughout the day.

The shirt features a patch pocket on the left chest and a full front buttoned placket. The inclusion of the patch pocket gives the shirt a slightly more casual feel, which aligns with the product description indicating its versatility for both work and social settings.

Analyzing the fit, the product details specify that the shirt has a "Regular" fit. This means it should not be too tight or too loose and should be suitable for a wide range of body types. The fit on the model appears to be as described, with the shirt draping well on the body without billowing or pulling â€“ assuming the model represents an accurate size 40 as stated under 'model statistics'.

For care, the shirt requires hand or machine wash in cold water with mild detergent, and users are instructed to wash dark colours separately. This is standard care advice for maintaining the colour and fabric integrity of cotton garments. The shirt should not be bleached and must be tumble dried low or dried in shade, suggesting that high heat or direct sunlight could potentially damage the fabric or cause it to fade. The instructions also recommend a warm iron, which is typical for cotton shirts to remove wrinkles for a crisp appearance.

From the styling point of view, based on the image and the product description, this shirt is versatile and can be paired with formal trousers and leather shoes for a professional look, or with jeans for a more casual ensemble. Considering these points, this shirt can make a versatile addition to a wardrobe, offering a mix of utility for various occasions - from work to more relaxed social settings.

The image itself features a model who wears the shirt in question paired with what appears to be beige trousers and a black belt, which demonstrates one way the shirt can be styled for a smart-casual look. The model's posture and the outfit's coordination are presented in a clean and attractive manner that is likely to appeal to shoppers looking for a flexible clothing option.
