The product depicted in the image is a girl's denim skirt. Based on the details provided, the skirt has several features that are aligned with typical denim construction while offering stylistic touches that enhance its appeal and functionality:

- **Composition**: The skirt is made of navy blue denim, which is a durable and classic fabric choice for casual wear. Denim is known for its strength and long-lasting wear.

- **Closure**: It features a front zippered and buttoned closure, which is a common and practical design that allows for ease of wearing and securing the garment.

- **Waist and Belt Loops**: The skirt includes loops around the waist, which are designed to accommodate a belt for additional fitting adjustments.

- **Pockets**: There are two side pockets and an extra small pocket inside the right pocket, offering utility for carrying small items. The back of the skirt has two additional pockets, further contributing to the functional aspect of the skirt.

- **Belt**: The skirt comes together with a floral cotton fabric belt which adds a colorful and playful touch, making it more stylish and appealing for a young demographic.

- **Fitting**: The skirt is described as having a regular fit, which likely means it's not too tight or too loose, ensuring comfort for the wearer.

- **Wash Care**: The care instructions provide guidance for the longevity and maintenance of the skirt. It should be machine washed in cold water with similar colours and on a delicate cycle. The buyer is advised not to bleach the skirt, to tumble dry on low or lay it flat to dry, and to use a warm iron if needed but avoid ironing directly on any print.

The skirt's design seems intended for a young audienceâ€”potentially toddlers to pre-teens, given the whimsical nature of the floral belt and the description suggesting it be paired with a girly top and sandals. The overall design and care instructions suggest a balance between practicality, durability, and an aesthetic that caters to young girls.
