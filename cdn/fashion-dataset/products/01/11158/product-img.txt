The product depicted in the image appears to match the description provided in your query. It is a silver-colored tie with a classic style that has distinguishing features such as self ribsâ€”a design element that creates raised lines or textures on the tie itself. The ribs give the tie a sophisticated aesthetic, making it suitable for formal or business occasions.

Based on the description, the tie's length is 153 cm, which is a standard length that accommodates various user heights and knot styles. The material is 100% handmade microfiber, which is known for its durability and ease of care, although the care instructions specify that it should only be dry cleaned.

In the image, the tie is displayed in a manner that shows off its contrasting textures. The broader end of the tie has horizontal ribs, while the narrower end, closer to the tapered point, features thin diagonal ribs alternating with plain fabric. This contrast in texture provides the tie with visual interest and an element of depth.

Additionally, there is mention of a loop with a brand badge on the inner side of the broad tongue, which helps keep the tie looking neat by holding the narrower end in place. This cannot be seen in the image, as the feature would be on the backside of the tie.

The image clearly presents the tie with adequate lighting and a plain background, enhancing the visibility of the tie's details and making it appealing for potential customers browsing online. The tie is not shown in use or paired with any particular shirt, which is common for product-only shots. Instead, it is arranged in a slightly rolled form at the top and laid out straight, ensuring all textures and details are visible for comprehensive viewing.
