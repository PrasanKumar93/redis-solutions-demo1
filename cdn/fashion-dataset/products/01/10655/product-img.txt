The product displayed in the image is a navy blue denim skirt intended for young girls. The skirt features a front closure with a zipper and button, which are common functional elements that ensure the skirt is secure and easy to wear.

Around the waist, there are belt loops that provide the option to wear a belt for additional styling or fit adjustment. The skirt also comes with a floral cotton fabric belt, which adds a playful and vibrant touch to the overall design. The belt, shown tied in a bow, has varying shades of purple with floral patterns, contributing to the skirt's visually appealing aesthetic.

The denim skirt has a classic five-pocket designâ€”two side pockets and a smaller right pocket nested inside one of them, and two back pockets, which are standard for most denim bottoms, facilitating functionality and adding to the casual style.

The hem of the skirt appears to be neatly finished, which suggests good craftsmanship. Since it is described as having a regular fit, it implies the skirt is designed to fit comfortably without being too tight or too loose.

The wash care instructions provided suggest that this skirt is reasonably easy to care for: machine washable with similar colors in a delicate cycle, non-bleachable, and suitable for tumble drying on low or line drying. It also specifies that it should be ironed with care, avoiding direct ironing on any print decorations.

This denim skirt by the brand "doodle," as described, seems to be a charming and practical garment for young girls. The styling recommendations indicate that it can be paired with a feminine top and sandals, making it versatile for different occasions and suitable for a trendy and casual child's wardrobe.
