The product shown in the image is a men's polo neck t-shirt featuring a striped pattern with blue, black, and white colors. The t-shirt is made of 100% cotton, which suggests that it should be comfortable to wear and breathable, making it suitable for everyday use or casual events.

The t-shirt's design includes a tipped collar, which is typically a contrasting color or pattern on the edge or tip of the collar, adding a stylish element to the shirt. Additionally, there is a buttoned chest placket, which means there are buttons running partway down from the collar, offering some adjustability for comfort and fit.

The sleeves of the t-shirt are short, making it appropriate for warmer weather or for layering under a sweater or jacket. There is also a vented hem, which generally refers to small slits at the sides of the bottom hem that allow for greater range of motion and provide a more relaxed fit around the hips and waist.

As for branding, there is an embroidered logo on the left chest of the t-shirt. This embroidery could potentially act as an identifier of the brand and adds a touch of sophistication to the garment.

The model in the image is displaying the t-shirt paired with denim jeans. This combination further accentuates the casual and versatile look of the t-shirt, suggesting that it could easily be incorporated into a casual wardrobe.

Overall, the t-shirt appears to be styled in a way that's classic and sporty, with additional features like the embroidered logo and the vented hem that elevate its design and functionality.
