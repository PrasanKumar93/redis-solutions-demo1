The image showcases a white, long-sleeved formal shirt worn by a male model. The shirt is characterized by its composition of 60% cotton and 40% polyester, indicating a balance of natural fabric for breathability and synthetic material for durability and ease of care. The dobby weaving with black thread visible on the front of the shirt provides a subtle design element that adds texture and visual interest without overpowering the shirt's formal aesthetic. 

This slim-fitting shirt is designed to provide a contemporary silhouette, likely to be flattering for the wearer, as it tends to contour closer to the body than a regular or relaxed fit.

The care instructions for the shirt are detailed, emphasizing the need for gentle washing practices such as cold water at 30Â°C and using mild detergent. It is recommended to wash dark colors separately to prevent color bleeding, and the shirt should not be bleached. Tumble drying should be done at a low setting, or alternatively, the shirt can be dried in the shade to preserve its shape and color. A warm iron can be used to remove any wrinkles, ensuring the shirt maintains a crisp, professional appearance.

The product description mentions that the shirt can transform a formal work wardrobe with its fresh, crisp look and suggests pairing it with well-fitting formal trousers and leather shoes, creating a complete office-appropriate ensemble.

The model wearing the shirt is described to have specific statistics, wearing a size 40 shirt, with a height of 6 feet and shoulder width of 18 inches. These details are provided to help potential buyers gauge how the shirt might fit them based on the model's physique.

The image itself is professionally shot, with a clear view of the shirt from a straight-on angle, allowing customers to easily scrutinize the details of the shirt's design and weaving pattern. It is important to note that actual product color and texture might slightly vary due to photographic lighting sources or individual monitor settings.

Overall, the product is presented as a stylish and functional addition to a formal wardrobe, offering a blend of aesthetic appeal and practical features like ease of care and comfortable wearing.
