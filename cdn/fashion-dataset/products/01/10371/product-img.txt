The product in question is a black printed sweatshirt. Based on the details provided and the analysis of the image, we can summarize the following key points about the product:

1. Material Composition:
   The sweatshirt is made from a blend of 80% cotton and 20% polyester. This combination suggests that the garment is likely designed to be comfortable and wearable in various temperatures, providing both warmth and breathability due to the cotton, with added durability and reduced shrinkage thanks to the polyester content.

2. Design Features:
   - The sweatshirt has full sleeves with ribbed cuffs, which are useful for providing a snug fit at the wrists and retaining warmth.
   - There is a ribbed hem at the bottom of the sweatshirt, contributing to both the fit and the aesthetic.
   - A zippered chest placket with a mock collar adds a visual element to the sweatshirt and allows for adjustable neck coverage and comfort.
   - There are two kangaroo pockets with stitch detailing, which not only serve a functional purpose but also enhance the overall design.
   - The front of the sweatshirt features a graphic print that appears to consist of various textual elements and possibly urban imagery, giving it a contemporary and casual look.

3. Fitting:
   The product is described as having a 'Comfort' fit, suggesting it is designed to be loose enough for ease of movement without being overly baggy.

4. Care Instructions:
   - The sweatshirt requires delicate machine wash at 30 degrees with a mild detergent, indicating that the product should be treated gently to maintain its quality.
   - It should not be dry cleaned, tumble dried, wrung, scrubbed, or bleached. These restrictions are likely set to preserve the material integrity and the print on the sweatshirt.
   - The garment is to be dried flat in shade, reducing the risk of shape distortion and color fading.
   - Ironing is permitted, but warm iron should be used, and direct contact with the print/embroidery is to be avoided to prevent damage.
