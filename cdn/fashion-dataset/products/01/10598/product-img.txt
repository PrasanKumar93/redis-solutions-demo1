**Composition:**
- The shirt is made of 100% cotton, which suggests that it is breathable and suitable for wear in various climates, particularly warmer weather.
- The fabric appears to be a lightweight denim given the color and texture visible in the image, making it appropriate for a relaxed yet stylish look.

**Design Elements:**
- The shirt features short sleeves with foldover hems, secured by buttoned flaps, which adds a practical design element, allowing the wearer to adjust sleeve length.

- It includes a flap pocket on the left chest adorned with metallic embellishments, enhancing the visual appeal of the shirt with a slight contrast and detailing.
- The shirt has a curved hemline, which contributes to the casual style and might also provide a flattering fit over the hips.

**Fit and Size:**
- The fitting is described as "Regular," which generally means it should not be too tight or too loose, but rather provide a comfortable fit that follows the body's natural lines without restricting movement.
- The model in the image is wearing size M, which corresponds to her height of 5’8” and chest measurement of 33". This can provide potential buyers with a reference for how the shirt may fit on their own bodies.

- Immediate removal after washing and line drying inside-out is suggested, protecting the color and material from potential damage caused by excessive heat or direct sunlight.
- Warm ironing is advised, which helps maintain the shirt's crisp appearance and can be necessary given that 100% cotton can be prone to wrinkling.
