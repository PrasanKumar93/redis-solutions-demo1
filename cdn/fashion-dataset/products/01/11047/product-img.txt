The product depicted in the image is a men's half-sleeve shirt with a red and blue plaid check design, accented by black and white stripes. The shirt is made of 100% cotton, which suggests it should be soft, breathable, and comfortable for daily wear. Its design includes buttoned patch pockets on the chest, which feature stud detailing for added visual interest and potentially enhanced durability. The shirt also has a full-length buttoned placket, classic for a shirt of this design, and a curved hemline, which lends itself to being worn untucked for a casual look. Notable are the attached loops, likely near the hemline, which may serve as points for securing the shirt or adding a stylistic detail.

The fitting of this shirt is described as "comfort," which implies a more relaxed fit that is not too tight, allowing for ease of movement and a casual, laid-back aesthetic. As for the care instructions, the shirt requires standard procedures for cotton garments; it should be washed in cold water with mild detergent, with dark colors washed separately. It is recommended not to bleach the shirt, to tumble dry on a low setting, dry it in the shade, and iron it with warm heat. These care instructions are important for maintaining the shirt's color and structural integrity over time.

The model in the image is wearing a size M shirt and has a height of 6 feet with 18-inch shoulders.

The mention of pairing the shirt with corduroys implies it is versatile for different types of outfits, suitable for a semi-formal look that is not too formal nor too casual - ideal for occasions like casual Fridays or relaxed social gatherings. The shirt's pattern and design make it suited for a youthful, stylish demographic looking for a contemporary twist on the classic plaid shirt.
