The t-shirt material is 100% cotton, which generally offers good breathability and comfort for everyday wear. The color grey is versatile and can be paired with various clothing items and colors, making it a flexible piece for a variety of casual outfits.

The fit of the t-shirt is described as 'comfort,' which suggests it is designed for a relaxed and comfortable wear, rather than a tight or tailored fit.

The graphic print includes numbers and text related to motor-themed elements, indicating that the design may appeal to individuals interested in motorbikes or the associated lifestyle. The prominence of the graphic print also makes it the focal point of the t-shirt's design.

Care instructions indicate that the t-shirt should only be hand washed in cold water with a mild detergent, which is important to maintain the garment's condition and prevent damage to the fabric and print. Users are advised to wash dark colors separately, avoid bleaching, wringing or tumble drying, and to flat dry in the shade to preserve the color and shape. Ironing should be done mildly and not on the print, to avoid ruining the graphic design.

The model statistics provided mention that the model wears a size M and has a height of 6 feet with shoulders measuring 18 inches. This information helps potential buyers to gauge how the t-shirt might fit them, based on the appearance of the t-shirt on the model.

In summary, the product is a casual, motor-themed graphic t-shirt made from 100% cotton, offering a comfortable fit and easy to pair with different bottoms for a casual, relaxed look. Customers are expected to follow specific washing instructions to maintain the garmentâ€™s quality.
