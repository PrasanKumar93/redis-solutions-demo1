Based on the product details provided:

**Composition:**
- 65% Polyester: A synthetic fabric known for its strength, durability, and resistance to wrinkles and shrinking.
- 35% Viscose: A type of rayon, which is a semi-synthetic fabric made from wood pulp. Viscose is known for being soft, lightweight, and having a silky finish.

The combination of these materials likely results in a garment that is comfortable to wear, with a slight stretch and a smooth texture that drapes well.

**Fitting:**
- Comfort: This suggests the tunic is designed to not be overly tight and allows for some level of ease and movement when worn.

**Wash Care:**
Maintenance seems to involve a delicate approach:
- Machine washable at 30 degrees Celsius using a mild detergent, which is lower than usual washing temperatures to maintain the garment's integrity and print quality.
- It's not suitable for dry cleaning, tumble drying, wringing, scrubbing, or bleaching, as these can damage the material and the print.
- Drying flat in the shade will prevent the garment from stretching out of shape and protect the color and print from fading.
- Warm ironing is permissible, but direct ironing on the print or embroidery must be avoided to prevent damage.

**Styling Recommendation:**
The product is heightened in style, recommended for warm winter days and is touted as a choice for those who value both fashion and comfort. The styling suggestions include pairing it with slim-fit jeans and stilettos for a chic look, accompanied by long earrings to add to the outfit's elegance.

The model presents the tunic in size M. Her height is 5 feet 8 inches, and she has a chest measurement of 33 inches, which helps potential buyers to visualize how the top would fit on a person with similar measurements.

She has a confident stance with her hands lightly touching the hem of the tunic, which suggests a comfortable and relaxed fit.
