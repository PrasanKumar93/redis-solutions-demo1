The product in the image is a black round neck t-shirt made of 100% cotton. The t-shirt features short sleeves and a graphic print on the front, which seems to be related to a theme of a "Blast from the Past" or speculative future where dinosaurs might return. The print is executed in lighter colors, contrasting with the dark background of the fabric. The t-shirt is designed for a comfort fit, which suggests it should be relatively loose and not tightly fitted to the body.

The wash care instructions provided stipulate that the t-shirt should be hand washed separately in cool water at 30 degrees. It should not be scrubbed or bleached. The garment must be turned inside out and allowed to dry flat in the shade to protect the print and the fabric. It is recommended to use warm iron on the reverse and specifically not to iron on the print to avoid damage.

The product has an environmental message, possibly advocating for the conservation of the earth with a humorous or fantastical twist involving dinosaurs. It is suggested to be paired with jeans and sports shoes or shorts and sandals for a casual, trendy look.

The model in the image is wearing a size M and his statistics are provided for reference: a height of 5'11" and shoulder width of 18". This information can help potential buyers to gauge the fit and look of the t-shirt based on their own measurements.

Overall, the t-shirt appears to be a casual wear item targeted at customers who enjoy comfortable, environmentally conscious clothing with a quirky or whimsical design.
