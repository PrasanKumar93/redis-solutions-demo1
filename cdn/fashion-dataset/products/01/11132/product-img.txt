It features a rectangular dial, in line with the provided product details that mention a 20mm case diameter and rectangular dial shape. The chunky, heavy-duty design gives it a robust appearance, suitable for everyday wear in an urban environment or casual activities. The watch appears to be versatile enough to be worn with a range of outfits due to its neutral color scheme, with a primarily white plastic case, plus a red accent on the side that adds a touch of style.

The rubber straps have a texture to it, suggesting a comfortable and secure grip on the wrist, and the tang clasp ensures that the watch can be easily put on or taken off.
