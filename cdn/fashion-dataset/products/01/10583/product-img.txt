1. **Design Aesthetics**: The watch adopts a classic rectangular watch face design, which gives it a traditional and elegant look. A modern twist appears to be in the form of the watch's color scheme and the styling of the numerals.

2. **Color Scheme**: The watch has a gold-toned case which suggests a premium and luxurious aesthetic. The use of gold is often associated with sophistication and is a common choice for a timeless piece. The black strap contrasts with the gold tones, providing a classic color combination that is versatile for various fashion styles.

3. **Watch Face**: The dial is white, which provides a clear background for the gold hour markers and watch hands, enhancing legibility. The numerals are large and stylized, with only 12 and 6 being indicated by numbers and the rest with line markers, contributing to the modern simplicity of the design.

4. **Brand and Model**: The brand name "ESPRIT" is clearly readable on the watch face, positioned centrally, which emphasizes the brand's identity. The model name "Nova Genesis" is, however, not visible in the watch itself but is provided in the product details.

5. **Strap**: The strap appears to be made of leather with a crocodile pattern, a frequently used material for watch straps due to its durability and elegance. The black color of the strap makes it suitable for both casual and formal wear.

6. **Watch Case and Crown**: The case has a distinctive design with layered elements that add depth, while the crown appears to be of a standard size, presumably for adjusting the time.

7. **Time Indicators**: There are two hands visible, likely representing hours and minutes. The absence of a second hand indicates a preference for a cleaner design and might also suggest a quieter operation without the ticking sound of a second hand.
