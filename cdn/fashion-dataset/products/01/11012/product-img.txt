The product in question is a women's top featuring a checked pattern in navy blue, red, yellow, and white. The top is made from 100% cotton, which suggests that it should be soft, breathable, and comfortable to wear, particularly suitable for warm weather or layering during cooler seasons. The jabot collar enhances its aesthetic with a touch of ruffled detailing, contributing to the garment's semi-formal look. A buttoned chest placket is present, allowing for adjustability in terms of neckline fit and styling.

Moreover, the top has rolled-up sleeves which introduce a casual flair to the outfit and adds to the versatility of the garment, accommodating different temperatures and preferences. The curved hemline facilitates a flattering fit over the hips and offers the option to be worn tucked or untucked, depending on the occasion and the wearer's style. There is embroidered branding on the left hem, which is a standard feature on branded apparel, offering subtle brand recognition.

The washing instructions are specific and detailed, highlighting that this item requires gentle care to maintain its quality and appearance. Hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent is recommended, and it is advised to wash dark colors separately. Users should avoid bleaching, wringing, or tumble drying the top and should instead flat dry it in shade to prevent discoloration or damage from direct sunlight. A mild iron is permissible, but direct ironing on any print, embellishment, or embroidery should be avoided to prevent damage.

The top is described as great for semi-formal wear, implying that it can be suitably paired with different types of bottoms such as slim-fit jeans, as suggested, or perhaps a skirt for a more dressed-up occasion. Ballerina shoes are recommended as a footwear pairing, which further emphasizes its versatility in creating a stylish ensemble suited to various informal or semi-formal settings.
