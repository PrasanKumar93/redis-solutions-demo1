2. **Color Scheme**: The watch sports a predominantly black color theme with white and red accents. The use of white for the hour markers and hands enhances legibility, while the red second hand adds a pop of color that also improves visibility of the sweep second function.

3. **Dial Features**: The dial includes several layers and textures, contributing to its modern aesthetic. There's a 24-hour indicator sub-dial positioned at the 3 o'clock position. Large numeral indices for 12, 4, and 8 are prominently displayed. Minute markers are laid out on the outer rim, with a tachymeter scale indication as well.

4. **Strap Material**: The watch strap appears to be made of leather, with what looks like white stitching details which provides a nice contrast to the black strap and adds to the overall visual appeal.

5. **Case and Crown**: The case seems to be made of a matte black material, which could be a metal such as stainless steel, often used for its durability and longevity. The crown and pushers are placed on the right side of the case which are typical for controlling the watch functions.

6. **Size and Proportions**: The watch has a significant presence on the wrist, given the size of the dial and the strap width. These proportions suggest it's targeted toward a market segment that prefers larger watch faces.
