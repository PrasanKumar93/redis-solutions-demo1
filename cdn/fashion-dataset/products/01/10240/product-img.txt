From the image, we can observe the following features and attributes:

1. Dial: The watch has a black dial featuring large Arabic numerals for 6, 9, and 12 o'clock hour markings. It also has minute markings around the circumference of the dial and a date window at the 3 o'clock position. The numerals and minute markings are designed with a white or light color, which provides a good contrast against the black background for ease of readability.

2. Case and Bezel: The metallic case appears to be finished in a gold-tone, adding to the watch's stylish and upscale look. The bezel is fixed and has a minute track which complements the overall design of the watch. The case diameter is stated to be 47 mm, with a thickness of 10 mm, a size which makes it a prominent piece on the wrist, suitable for those who prefer larger watches.

3. Strap: The strap is made of leather and comes with a tang clasp for securing the watch around the wearer's wrist. The color seems to match the black dial.

4. Movement: According to the product details, the watch is powered by a quartz movement which is common for accuracy and low maintenance in wristwatches.

5. Water Resistance: The watch is described as water-resistant, making it suitable for swimming, but the specific depth rating is not provided in the details. It would be essential for potential customers to know this to assess the watch's suitability for their needs.

6. Case Back: The solid stainless steel case back is mentioned as enhancing the durability of the watch, which is an asset for longevity and wear.

7. Adjustability: The product details mention a screw to reset the time and date. Often referred to as the crown, it appears to be in a typical position on the side of the watch case.

Overall, the image and the accompanying details portray a robust and fashionable wristwatch that would be suitable for everyday wear as well as for more formal occasions where style and a modern twist on a classic design are appreciated. The use of contrasting colors, the size of the dial, and the overall finish would likely appeal to customers looking for a statement accessory that is both functional and stylish.
