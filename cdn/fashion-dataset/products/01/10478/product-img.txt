The product depicted in the image is a short-sleeved men's shirt with a maroon and white plaid check pattern, featuring black accents. Constructed from 100% cotton, the shirt presents a comfortable and breathable option suitable for casual wear. The shirt has rolled cuffs with buttoned flaps, which add a stylistic touch, allowing the wearer to modify the look slightly by unrolling the cuffs if desired.

There are two patch pockets on the chest, each secured with a buttoned flap, providing a practical element as well as a visual detail that contributes to the shirt's casual style. Directly above the right chest pocket, there's embroidered branding, which is a common feature used by brands for subtle marketing and identification.

The buttoned placket is enhanced with tape detailing on the inside of the facing side, suggesting a thoughtful design aspect that might only be visible when the shirt is unbuttoned. This detail may also reinforce the placket for better durability.

Regarding the fit, the product description states that it is a regular fit, which typically means it is designed to be neither too tight nor too loose, offering a good balance of comfort and form.

The care instructions emphasize the importance of machine washing the shirt in cold water to prevent shrinkage or color bleeding. The recommendation against tumble drying and drying in direct sunlight is likely to preserve the fabric's quality and color over time. Turning the shirt inside out before drying can protect the outer surface and any prints, while using a warm iron and avoiding ironing over prints ensures the shirt maintains its appearance.

Based on the model statistics provided, the model in the image is wearing a size M. The model's dimensions are described as a height of 6 feet with 19-inch shoulders. This information is helpful for potential buyers to gauge how the shirt might fit based on their own measurements.

Finally, the product description suggests styling the shirt with jeans or chinos and slip-on shoes for a laid-back look, aligning with its casual, easygoing style.
