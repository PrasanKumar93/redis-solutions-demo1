The product shown in the image is a full-sleeved shirt in a vibrant peacock blue color. Based on the details provided, the shirt is made of 100% cotton which suggests that it is likely to be comfortable and breathable, suitable for everyday wear as well as formal occasions. Cotton is a natural fabric known for its softness and comfort, making it an excellent choice for a shirt that might be worn throughout a workday.

The shirt features a classic fit, which is typically designed to be looser than a slim fit, offering a more relaxed silhouette which allows for ease of movement. The classic fit is versatile and suitable for various body types, as it is not too tight or too loose.

There is a patch pocket on the left chest that adds to the functionality and style of the shirt. The full-length buttoned placket is a standard feature on formal shirts, providing a clean and smart look. Embroidery of brand initials on the right cuff may serve as a subtle branding detail, adding a touch of sophistication to the overall design.

The care instructions mentioned are fairly standard for cotton garments. The shirt can be machine or hand washed at 40 degrees Celsius, which is a moderate temperature that helps in maintaining the fabric's integrity and color over time. Customers are advised to wash dark colors separately to prevent dye transfer, avoid bleaching which can damage the fabric and color, and tumble dry on normal settings. The recommendation for hot ironing is typical for cotton, as it can handle higher temperatures necessary to remove wrinkles for a crisp appearance.

The model shown wearing the shirt provides a representation of how the shirt might fit on a person with similar dimensions. The model is stated to be wearing size M, with a height of 6 feet and shoulder width of 18 inches, which provides potential buyers with a point of reference for sizing.

The styling suggestion provided in the description encourages pairing the shirt with well-fitting formal trousers and leather shoes for a professional office look. The peacock blue color stands out as a fresh and potentially appealing choice for someone looking to add a pop of color to their formal wardrobe without straying too far from the traditional office attire.

Overall, this product seems well-suited for individuals looking for a comfortable, smart, and slightly distinct formal shirt to wear in professional settings or on formal occasions.
