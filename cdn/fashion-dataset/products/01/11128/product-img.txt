- **Fit**: They seem to have a relaxed, possibly straight fit, with a comfortable look that doesn't cling tightly to the body.

- **Color**: The pants are in a neutral, light beige or off-white color, which makes them versatile for pairing with a variety of tops.

- **Material**: Although the specific material isn't mentioned in the product details, the care instructions suggest it's a fabric sensitive to harsh cleaning methods, which may indicate the use of a natural and potentially delicate fabric such as cotton or linen.
