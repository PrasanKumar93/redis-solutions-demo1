Based on the provided details and the image, the product is a men's long-sleeve casual shirt featuring white, green, and navy blue stripes. The shirt is made from 100% cotton which suggests it would be soft, comfortable, and breathable – suitable for various seasons but particularly favorable in warmer weather due to cotton's natural ability to wick away moisture and keep the body cool.

The shirt entails details such as a brand badge embroidered on the left chest, which adds a distinct branding element to the garment. Additionally, there is a snap button on the elbow, indicating the sleeves can likely be rolled up and fastened, adding versatility to the style and providing a more casual look when desired. The shirt has a full-length buttoned placket which is a standard design feature for such shirts, allowing easy closure, and a curved hemline that contributes to a casual and modern silhouette, which can be worn untucked for a relaxed look or tucked in for a more formal appearance.

The fitting is described as regular, meaning it should not be too tight or too loose, aiming to fit a wide range of body types comfortably.

Wash care instructions include gentle machine wash at lukewarm water temperatures around 40 degrees Celsius, suggesting the fabric is robust enough to handle machine washing but with some specifics to prolong its integrity. Washing dark colors separately is a common caution with garments to prevent color transfer. There should be no bleaching, and tumble drying is suggested to be on normal setting or simply line dried, which would minimize potential shrinkage and fabric wear. A warm iron is recommended for maintenance of the shirt's appearance – this could help in smoothing out any creases due to the cotton fabric's tendency to wrinkle.

The image depicts a male model wearing the shirt, styled with the sleeves rolled up to the forearm and secured with the snap button, showcasing the shirt's versatility. The model is also wearing jeans, which complements the casual design of the shirt as recommended in the product description. The vibrant stripes and the fitted design visible in the image corroborate the playful yet stylish nature of the shirt that targets a casual and modern aesthetic.

As per the "Model statistics," likely provided to assist potential customers in gauging the fit of the shirt, the model is wearing size M, with a height of 6 feet and shoulder breadth of 19 inches. This information can be particularly useful for online shoppers trying to understand how the shirt might fit on their body type.

Overall, the product is positioned as a stylish, everyday wear item that could be a good addition to a casual wardrobe, especially for those looking to diversify beyond t-shirts for social occasions such as weekend parties.
