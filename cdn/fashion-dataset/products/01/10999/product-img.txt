The product image provided seems to be of a wristwatch from Puma. The following details can be observed from the image and the product description:

1. **Design and Style**: The watch has a bold aesthetic with a black rectangular dial featuring the Puma logo. This type of design may appeal to individuals looking for a sporty and fashion-forward accessory.

2. **Dial Features**: The watch's dial has sub-dials, which likely serve as chronograph functions allowing the wearer to use the watch as a stopwatch in addition to telling the time. The combination of yellow and black on the dial gives it a striking contrast that enhances its visual appearance and readability.

3. **Numerals and Markings**: The hour markings are indicated with large numerals at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, and the other hours are marked by lines. The sub-dials also have numerical markings for their specific functions.

4. **Hands**: The watch has luminous hands, which makes it easier to read the time in low-light conditions. The second hand appears to be in a yellow color that stands out against the black dial background.

5. **Crown and Pushers**: On the side, there appear to be a main crown for time adjustments and additional pushers, which would typically be used to operate the chronograph functions.

6. **Band**: The band looks to be made of black leather with stitching details, which suggests a comfortable and durable design. The texture of the band appears to provide a nice tactile quality and the black color gives it a versatile look that can match various outfits.

7. **Water Resistance**: While not explicitly stated in the description or visible in the image, many active watches like this one tend to offer some level of water resistance, which would be a beneficial feature for those engaging in sports or other activities where moisture or water exposure is possible.

8. **Brand Recognition**: With the Puma brand logo prominently displayed, this watch leverages brand recognition and may appeal to brand-loyal customers or those looking to associate with Puma's sporty and stylish brand image.

However, the product description is cut off and does not fully describe all the watch's features or specifications.
