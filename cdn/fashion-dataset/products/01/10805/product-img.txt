The product in the image is a men's black shirt, which is described as being made of 100% cotton. The shirt features full arm cuff sleeves equipped with a mid-sleeve buttoned flap, which appears to be useful for keeping the sleeves in place when they are rolled up. The inclusion of a tipped collar and a full front buttoned placket gives it a stylish yet classic shirt look. Additionally, there is a patch pocket on the left chest, embellished with what is described as embroidered branding, although the branding itself is not visible in the provided image.

The shirt has a curved hemline, which is a design aspect that allows it to be worn both tucked and untucked, providing different styling options for the wearer. According to the product details, the shirt is meant to offer a comfortable fit, which is suggested to be neither too tight nor too loose, conducive to everyday wear and semi-formal occasions.

The wash care instructions indicate that the shirt should only be hand washed in cold water with a mild detergent. It should not be bleached, wrung, or tumble dried, and should be flat dried in the shade to preserve its color and shape. The shirt should also be ironed mildly with caution to avoid ironing over any print, embellishment, or embroidery, which is standard care for items of this nature to ensure longevity and maintained appearance.

The model in the image wears a size M, and he, according to the product description, has a height of 6 feet with 18-inch shoulders. This provides a reference for potential buyers regarding the size and fit of the shirt relative to the model's physique.

Overall, the product can be classified as a versatile wardrobe piece aimed at customers seeking a durable and easy-to-style garment for casual or semi-formal environments. The style advice given—suggesting to team the shirt with jeans and sports shoes—supports a contemporary, urban attire.
