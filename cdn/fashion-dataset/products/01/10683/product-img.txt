    - There is a graphic print on the front with numbers and letters that evoke an athletic vibe. It says "END Athletic Dep DN-JA," suggesting a sports department theme. The print uses a distressed style, which adds a trendy, worn-in look that is often popular in casual and athleisure wear.

    - It should be washed on a delicate cycle to maintain the integrity of the fabric and print.
    - The item should not be bleached, preserving the color and print integrity.
    - Tumble-drying should be on low or the garment should be laid flat to dry, to prevent excessive shrinkage or wear from high heat.
