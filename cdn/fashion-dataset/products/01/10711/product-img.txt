This product is a white t-shirt designed for a comfort fit, made from 100% cotton which suggests that it is likely to be soft, breathable, and comfortable to wear. The t-shirt features a round ribbed neckline that includes grey fabric tape on the inseam, which adds both style and structural integrity to the collar area. The short sleeves make it suitable for casual wear, especially in warmer weather or for layering under other garments.

On the visual front, the t-shirt has a prominent graphic print with the number "10" in a large font size, decorated with a polka dot pattern in a light blue color. Alongside the number 10, there are various small appliqu√© patches which appear to include letters and icons, adding to the playful and sporty design. These patches bring a three-dimensional texture to the garment.

In terms of care, the product requires machine washing at a warm temperature of 30 degrees Celsius with similar colors to prevent color bleeding. Bleach should not be used, presumably to protect the color and integrity of the fabric and print. It can be tumble dried on a low setting and ironed if necessary, although direct ironing on the design is discouraged to prevent damage. The t-shirt should not be dry cleaned.

The product description suggests that this t-shirt embodies a sense of sporty femininity and versatility, recommending that it can be paired with colorful skirts or jeans and tennis shoes for a casual and trendy look.
