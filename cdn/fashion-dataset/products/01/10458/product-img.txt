The product depicted in the image is a men's polo neck t-shirt. Here's a comprehensive analysis of the product based on the provided details and the visual information from the image:

**Fabric Composition:**

- The t-shirt is made from 100% cotton which suggests that it's likely to be soft, breathable, and comfortable for everyday wear. Cotton is a natural fiber known for its durability and ease of care.


**Design and Features:**

- The t-shirt has a green pique fabric which typically means it has a textured, woven look. Pique fabric is often used in polo shirts for its durable and breathable qualities.

- The collar and sleeve hems have ribbed detailing with white and purple tipping. This adds a contrast design element and a classic touch to the polo t-shirt.

- Tape detailing on the inseam of the collar could indicate reinforcement for durability and possibly an element of interior design which could add to the comfort when wearing it.

- The polo has a buttoned chest placket which appears to be a typical design with usually two or three buttons, allowing the wearer to adjust the opening of the neck for comfort or style.

- Embroidered branding on the left chest adds to the aesthetic with a logo or brand symbol, indicating the t-shirt's brand identity.

- An appliqued brand tab on the left hem might provide additional branding and is sometimes used as a hallmark of quality and authenticity.

- Vented hems are featured which allow for more movement and flexibility, particularly when the shirt is tucked in as they prevent the fabric from bunching up.


**Color:**

- The vibrant green of the shirt is eye-catching and could be suitable for both casual wear and for making a statement in a more dressed-up context.


**Fit and Styling:**

- While the exact fit of the t-shirt cannot be determined without information about its sizing (like slim fit, regular fit, etc.), it appears to conform well to the body of the model, which suggests a standard or regular fit.

- The t-shirt is styled with a pair of casual denim jeans, reflecting a typical use case for a polo shirt, which is versatile and can be paired with a variety of bottoms for different looks.


**Model Presentation:**

- The model is displaying the product with a front-facing stance, and his pose is relaxed. This allows potential customers to get a good view of how the t-shirt fits on the upper body, looking at shoulder seam placement, sleeve length, and overall drape.


Overall, this green pique polo neck t-shirt offers a combination of classic styling with a vibrant color and comfort-oriented features that make it suitable for a variety of casual occasions.
