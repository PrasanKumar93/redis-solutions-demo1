The product depicted in the image is a V-neck full-sleeve pullover, prominently featuring broad horizontal stripes in blue and green. The material composition is a blend of acrylic and wool, which typically provides a good balance between warmth, comfort, and ease of care. The construction of the pullover includes ribbing around the V-neck collar, cuffs, and hemline, which helps to maintain the shape of the garment and provides a snug fit at the edges.

Furthermore, on the left chest of the pullover, there is the "Scullers Association" logo, which appears to be applied using the flocking technique, giving the logo a slightly raised and textured finish. The fit of the pullover is described as regular, which usually means it's designed to provide a balance between a slim fit and a loose fit, making it suitable for a wide range of body types.

Wash care instructions indicate that the pullover should be washed separately from dark colors, which suggests that the colors might bleed. It can be either machine washed or hand washed cold with a mild detergent, which is typically recommended for preserving the quality and colors of the fabric. Additionally, the garment should not be wrung or bleached, and it should be laid flat to dry in the shade, which helps to prevent stretching and discoloration from sunlight.

His statistics are provided for reference: a height of 6'1", a chest measurement of 38.5", and shoulder width of 18.5". These measurements may help potential customers gauge how the pullover might fit on their own frames.

As for styling, the description suggests pairing the pullover with denim jeans and suede shoes for a casual winter look, implying that this item is versatile enough to be worn in casual settings while still offering a touch of style due to its smart stripe pattern and distinctive logo.

Overall, the pullover seems to be marketed as a stylish yet comfortable piece for winter wear, aimed at those who are looking for a smart-casual addition to their wardrobe.
