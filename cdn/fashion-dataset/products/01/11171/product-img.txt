The product depicted in the image is a men's striped round neck full-sleeve pullover. The sweater features a horizontal striped pattern consisting of grey, purple, cream, and black colors, providing a stylish and contemporary appearance. The stripes vary in thickness, with the cream and purple stripes being narrower than the grey and black ones, creating an eye-catching contrast.

The pullover is designed with ribbing around the neck, cuffs, and hemline, which not only adds to the design's aesthetic but also ensures a snug fit, helping to keep the wearer warm by preventing cold air from entering. The "scullers Association" logo is visibly applied on the left chest area with a flock applique technique that presents a raised and textured effect, contributing to the overall appeal of the garment.

The sweater's composition of acrylic and wool indicates a warm and durable fabric, ideal for winter wear. The blend of materials suggests the sweater should be soft to the touch while providing sufficient warmth. Acrylic contributes to the garment's shape retention and colorfastness, while wool provides natural insulation.

The fitting is described as "regular," suggesting a standard, not too tight or too loose, fit, which caters to a wide range of body types. This makes it a potentially versatile addition to a variety of wardrobes.

For wash care, specific instructions are given to maintain the quality of the sweater. It should be washed separately, especially from lighter colors, to prevent color bleeding. Both machine wash and hand wash are options, but mild detergent and cold water are recommended, and caution is advised against wringing or bleaching. It is to be flat-dried in the shade, which helps preserve its shape and color.

The model in the image is wearing size M, with his height and body measurements provided, which can help potential buyers gauge how the sweater might fit them.

The styling suggestion to pair it with denims and suede shoes positions the pullover as a versatile item suitable for a casual, yet stylish winter look.

Overall, the product appears to be well-presented with a balance of style and functionality. It seems to be a comfortable wardrobe piece aimed at those looking to combine casual style with winter comfort.
