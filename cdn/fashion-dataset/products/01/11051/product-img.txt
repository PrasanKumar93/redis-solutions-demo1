The product depicted in the image is a half-sleeve shirt featuring purple and white checks. The shirt is composed of 100% cotton, which suggests breathability and comfort, particularly suitable for casual or semi-formal wear during warmer seasons. The cotton fabric is also likely to contribute to the shirt's durability and ease of washing.

The shirt has several design elements that enhance its functionality and appeal:
1. It includes a patch pocket on the left chest, which adds utility and is adorned with an embroidered brand logo, hinting at the shirt's brand affiliation.
2. The full-length buttoned placket offers a classic look and ease of wearing.
3. Godet inserts on the sides may offer additional comfort and ease of movement, as these are triangular pieces of fabric that can make the shirt less restrictive.
4. A curved hemline offers a contemporary look and allows the shirt to be worn untucked while maintaining a sharp appearance.

The fitting is described as slim, which typically suggests a more body-conscious cut that is closer to the body, accentuating the wearer's physique. It is recommended to be attentive to sizing, particularly if the wearer prefers a looser fit.

For care, the shirt should be washed in cold water at 30Â°C with a mild detergent. It should be washed separately from dark colours to avoid color transfer and should not be bleached. Tumble drying should be done on low heat and drying in shade is advised to prevent fading and extending the life of the fabric. Warm ironing is recommended, likely on the cotton setting to remove wrinkles.

The model in the image wears a size M in t-shirts, has a height of 6 feet, and shoulder width of 18 inches, which can be helpful for online shoppers to gauge the shirt's fit and appearance on a similar build. The model presents the shirt worn in a typical fashion for an e-commerce setting: fully buttoned, untucked, and without additional layers or accessories, providing a clear view of the shirt on its own.

Pairing suggestions include wearing it with corduroys for a relaxed yet put-together look, which fits the semi-formal style the product description suggests.

Overall, the shirt appears to be versatile, suitable for a variety of semi-formal contexts or smart-casual dress codes. The color scheme and pattern make it flexible enough to be paired with various bottoms, from more formal trousers to casual jeans or chinos.
