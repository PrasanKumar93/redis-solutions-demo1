The image you provided shows a single brown closed sandal with a leather upper. The sandal displays several specific features described in the product details:

1. **Leather Upper with Cut-out Detail**: The top part of the sandal is crafted from brown leather, evident from the characteristic texture and sheen. The cut-out detail, consisting of multiple slits, serves both an aesthetic function and likely provides ventilation for the wearer's foot.

2. **Backfoot Strap**: At the back of the sandal, there is a visible strap with an adjustable fastener that would secure the sandal to the wearer's foot, ensuring a snug fit. The fastener seems to be a snap button, which is convenient for quick fastening and releasing.

3. **Leather Footbed with Massage Nubs**: Although the image does not show the inside of the sandal, the item description states a leather footbed featuring massage nubs. This likely implies added comfort and a massaging effect for the bottom of the foot when walking.

4. **Textured EVA Outsole with Patterned Grooves**: The sole of the sandal is made from EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate), a common material for footwear thanks to its light weight and cushioning properties. The texture and patterned grooves are visible, indicating that the outsole is designed to provide better traction and prevent slipping.

5. **Warranty**: The product comes with a 3-month warranty against manufacturing defects, which offers some reassurance to the buyer regarding the quality and durability of the sandals.

The color contrast between the brown leather upper and the dark sole adds visual interest and could make the sandals versatile for different fashion styles or occasions. The overall design looks sturdy and comfortable, likely suitable for casual wear. The attention to detail with the contrasting stitching indicates a level of craftsmanship which, along with the warranty, could justify a higher price point for these sandals.

Overall, the product presented in the image seems to adhere to the descriptions provided, and it would likely appeal to consumers looking for a durable, comfortable, and casual footwear option.
