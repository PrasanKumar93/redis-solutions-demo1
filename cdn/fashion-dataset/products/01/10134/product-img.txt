Based on the provided product details and the image, we can conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Esprit Lissomy analog wristwatch.

Design & Aesthetics:
- The watch features a traditional rectangular dial which gives it a classic and timeless look, but it has been modernized with contemporary design elements.
- The black dial of the watch is adorned with CZ (Cubic Zirconia) crystal embellishments at the top and bottom, providing a touch of luxury and sparkle.
- Roman numerals are used for the 6 and 12 o'clock positions, while silver lines mark the 2 to 4 o'clock and 8 to 10 o'clock intervals. This contributes to a minimalist yet elegant dial design.
- The brand name "Esprit" is visibly placed above the 6 o'clock mark, enhancing the brand recognition.

Materials & Build:
- The watch case and strap are made of steel, indicating durability and strength.
- It has a fixed bezel, which also appears to have CZ crystal embellishments.
- The leather-like texture on the strap suggests comfort and style, although the product description does not specify the strap material.
- A butterfly clasp is used for the strap, which is known for its security and ease of use.
- The mineral crystal glass provides scratch resistance, ensuring the watch remains in good condition over time.

Functionality:
- The watch features a quartz movement, which is known for keeping accurate time with minimal maintenance required.
- A screw is mentioned for resetting the time, commonly found as a crown on the side of the watch case.
- The product information confirms that the watch is water-resistant, suitable for everyday use such as handwashing or car-washing, but likely not for submersion in water or intense water sports.

Dimensions:
- The case diameter is given as 12 mm, which seems like a potential error or typo as this is very small for a watch case. Typically, case diameters range from 34 mm to 44 mm for adult watches. It might be a mistaken measurement or intended to be another dimension, such as case width.
- The case thickness is indicated as 7 mm, which suggests a relatively slim profile that might contribute to the watch being less obtrusive and more comfortable for daily wear.

Additional Features:
- The description alludes to a tool provided for adjusting the strap length, enhancing the watch's versatility and the ability for the wearer to tailor it to their individual wrist size.

Overall, the Esprit Lissomy analog wristwatch seems to present itself as an affordable, stylish, and versatile timepiece with details that cater to a modern yet classic aesthetic.
