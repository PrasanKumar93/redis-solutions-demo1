These instructions are important for preserving the fabric's feel and the integrity of the print.

The model's statistics are mentioned for reference, indicating that the model is wearing size M, is 6 feet tall, and has 18-inch shoulders. This information might help potential buyers to gauge the fit and length of the t-shirt based on their own measurements.
