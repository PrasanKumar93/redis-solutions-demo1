**Product Composition:**

- Turning the jeans inside out before drying is recommended to preserve the color and protect the outer surface from direct abrasion or sunlight.
- Drying in direct sunlight can lead to uneven fading and potential material damage.
- A warm iron is suitable for removing wrinkles, but one should avoid ironing over any prints or badges to prevent damage.
