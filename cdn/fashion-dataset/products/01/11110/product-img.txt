The product in the image is a men's long-sleeved dress shirt. The shirt has a small, repeating geometric pattern, which looks to be a check or grid-like design in a light color, most likely white, with what appears to be blue lines. The shirt has a pointed, fold-down collar, a placket front with buttons, and buttoned cuffs at the end of the sleeves. It has a standard fit, with no visible darts or seams that would indicate a slim or tailored fit. The individual in the image is wearing the shirt tucked into dark trousers and has a belt, suggesting a semi-formal to formal style suitable for a business or office setting.

Analyzing the wash care instructions provided:

- Wash dark colours separately: This suggests that the shirt could bleed color or that its color might run onto lighter clothing during washing.
- Hand wash or machine wash cold: The shirt requires gentle washing, which could mean it's made from materials that could shrink or be damaged with heat.
- Use mild detergent: This indicates a need for care to maintain the color and fabric integrity.
- Do not wring: Wringing could damage the fibers of the shirt or cause it to lose its shape.
- Flat dry in shade: Direct sunlight could possibly fade the color, and flat drying helps to maintain the shape of the shirt.
- Do not bleach: Bleaching agents could damage the fabric and affect the color.
- Do not iron on print: If there is a print or logo on the shirt, it could be damaged by the heat of an iron.

From the care instructions, it can be deduced that the shirt is likely made from a material that is prone to shrinkage or color loss, such as cotton or a cotton blend. It may also have a print that is sensitive to high heat.

Overall, the shirt appears to be a classic style piece for a men's wardrobe, versatile enough to be worn in a range of settings from casual to professional. The care instructions provide some hints as to the fabric care and suggest that the shirt requires a bit of maintenance to keep it looking its best.
