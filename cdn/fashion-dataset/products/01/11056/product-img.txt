The product depicted in the image is a half-sleeve shirt with a plaid check pattern in blue, green, and white. This shirt is composed of 100% cotton, which typically ensures breathability and comfort for the wearer. The shirt features buttoned patch pockets on both chests, accented with stud detailing, which adds a decorative yet functional element to the garment. The full-length buttoned placket is consistent with a typical shirt design, providing a classic and versatile closure method.

The curved hemline with attached loops suggests that the shirt is designed to be worn untucked, maintaining a casual yet tidy appearance. Additionally, the loops could be a design feature or might be used to secure the shirt in place when it's tucked in or to hang accessories.

The fitting is described as comfortable, which may imply a regular fit with some room for movement, offering a good balance between being too tight and overly loose. This makes the shirt suitable for a range of body types.

Care instructions specific to the shirt advise machine or hand washing in cold water at 30Â°C using a mild detergent. Like with many colored textiles, it is recommended to wash dark colors separately to avoid dye transfer. The instruction to avoid bleach helps in preserving the fabric and the color integrity of the shirt. It is advised to tumble dry on low and dry in shade, which might help prevent shrinkage and fabric damage due to excessive heat. Furthermore, a warm iron is suitable for removing wrinkles, which is common for cotton garments.

The product description suggests the shirt as a semi-formal option, perfect for occasions where neither formal attire nor casual wear is appropriate. The recommendation to pair it with corduroys for a "relaxed look" positions the shirt as versatile in a wardrobe, suitable for various settings such as casual workplaces, outings, or informal gatherings.

Regarding the model statistics, the shirt is worn by a model who typically wears size M in t-shirts, and the provided model's height and shoulder measurements give potential buyers a reference to gauge how the shirt might fit on their own bodies, assuming a similar build.

From the image, we can observe the shirt fitting the model without appearing too tight. The shoulder seams appear to align well with the model's natural shoulder line, which is essential for a comfortable fit. The clean backdrop of the photo allows for a focused view of the shirt, highlighting its design and fit on the model's torso. Overall, the shirt is presented as a casual yet refined garment that could be a versatile addition to a wardrobe.
