The image displays a white round neck t-shirt for women with mega sleeves and a graphic print on the front. The t-shirt appears to be made of 100% cotton, offering breathability and comfort for daily wear. The graphic depicts a vintage or Victorian-style image, which adds a distinctive and stylish visual element to the otherwise simple garment. This kind of print often appeals to consumers interested in a mix of classic and modern fashion influences.

The fitting of the t-shirt is described as "regular," which suggests it's designed to be neither overly tight nor excessively loose, providing a comfortable fit for a variety of body shapes. The model shown wears a size M and has the following measurements: height of 5â€™8" and a chest circumference of 33 inches. Observing the model, the garment seems to fit well, with the hem reaching the hip area, and the sleeves sitting just above the elbow, which is consistent with the "mega sleeve" design.

The care instructions for the t-shirt are quite specific, emphasizing the need to maintain the item's appearance and extend its life span. It's recommended to machine wash cold to prevent shrinking and preserve the color, avoid tumble drying, and turn the shirt inside out before drying, likely to protect the print. Additionally, it's advised not to dry the garment in direct sunlight to prevent fading and to use a warm iron if needed, carefully avoiding ironing over the print or embroidery to prevent damage.

For styling, the product description suggests pairing this t-shirt with jeans and sports shoes, which would align it with a casual, everyday aesthetic while highlighting its stylish print.

The image quality is clear, with good resolution and lighting, allowing potential buyers to see the texture of the fabric and the print design clearly.
