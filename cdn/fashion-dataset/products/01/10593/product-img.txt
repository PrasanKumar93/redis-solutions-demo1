The image provided depicts a rectangular-shaped analog wristwatch from the brand Esprit which is designed with a modern twist on traditional watch styles. This specific model is named Houston. The wristwatch showcases a purple and blue striped dial with the Esprit brand name running across it, between the 7 and 11 o'clock markings. Additionally, the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions are marked with simple lines in place of numerals, providing a minimalist design aesthetic.

The case appears to be made of a synthetic material, which is likely chosen for its durability and lightweight properties. The fixed bezel integrated into the case also contributes to both the watch's style and structural integrity. The watch strap is also synthetic and features a tang clasp, a common and easy-to-use closure mechanism for wristwatches. The colorful band harmonizes with the striped dial, indicating the watch might be targeted toward a fashion-conscious audience or those who prefer bold, vibrant accessory choices.

The dimensions of the case are provided in the product details: 22 mm in diameter and 9.5 mm in thickness. These dimensions suggest the watch is relatively small and slim, which could make it suitable for a range of wrist sizes and is often preferred for a sleeker look.

The watch movement is powered by Miyota quartz, a respected and widely-used type of movement known for its precision and reliability. Quartz movements are known for requiring minimal maintenance and offering accurate timekeeping.

Additionally, the watch features a water resistance of up to 30 meters, which means it is protected against light water exposure, such as hand washing or being caught in the rain. However, it is not suitable for swimming or diving.

In terms of styling, the product image reveals exact colors and design patterns that match the written description. The transparent case and strap elements hint at a modern and possibly youthful target market.

In conclusion, the Esprit Houston analog wristwatch presented in the image is a fashion-forward accessory that combines a modern design with traditional watch traits. Its features cater to consumers looking for both style and practicality in a timepiece, with its bold colors and reliable timekeeping mechanism.
