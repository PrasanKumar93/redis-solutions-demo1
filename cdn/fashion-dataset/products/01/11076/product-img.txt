The product in the image is a black pullover featuring horizontal white stripes. It has a V-neck design and the fabric composition includes 80% acrylic and 20% wool. This blend suggests that the pullover should offer both warmth and softness, as acrylic yarns are known for their ability to retain heat and wool is recognized for its warmth and natural breathability.

Observations about the pullover's design include:

- The V-neck shape, which can be suitable for layering over collared shirts.
- Ribbed detailing at the neckline, cuffs, and hem, which usually helps to provide a better fit and could prevent the edges from stretching out over time.
- A brand badge appliqued on the left chest, which adds a subtle element of branding to the garment.

The fitting is described as regular, which typically means the fit should not be too tight or too loose, allowing for comfort and ease of movement. This size and fit would potentially appeal to a wide audience looking for a standard fit.

The wash care instructions indicate the need for delicate handling:

- Machine or hand wash in cold water at 30Â°C with a mild detergent to preserve the integrity of the fabric and to prevent shrinking.
- Washing dark colors separately helps avoid dye transfer to lighter-colored garments.
- It is advised against bleaching or wringing the pullover, which could damage the fabric or alter the fit.
- Flat drying in shade is recommended to avoid direct sunlight that could potentially fade the black color.
- The instruction to not iron on the print likely refers to the brand badge, to prevent damage.

The model in the image is wearing a size M and is 6 feet tall with 18-inch shoulders. This information helps potential buyers gauge how the pullover might fit on a person of similar build.

Overall, the pullover is marketed as a stylish and practical addition to a wardrobe for cooler weather, with a classic color scheme that could be easily paired with various outfits like jeans or corduroy pants, enhancing the versatility of the garment.
