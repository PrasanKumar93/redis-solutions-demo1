The product in question is a blue polo neck t-shirt. Based on the image and the details provided, here is a comprehensive analysis of the product:

1. **Material:** The t-shirt is made of 100% cotton, which is a natural, breathable fabric that is commonly used for comfortable casual wear. Cotton is often appreciated for its soft texture and its ability to wick moisture, making it a suitable material for warmer climates.

2. **Color:** The shade of blue is vibrant and eye-catching. This type of color can be versatile in fashion, easily paired with various styles and colors of bottoms, such as jeans, chinos, or shorts.

3. **Collar and Placket:** The polo has a ribbed and tipped collar. This detail adds a touch of texture and design to the otherwise plain collar, and the tipping can add a contrasting color element, although it's not distinctly visible in the image. The placket is buttoned, which is typical of polo shirts, allowing the wearer to adjust the opening for comfort or style.

4. **Sleeves:** The short sleeves have ribbed hems, which provide a snugger fit around the arms and can help maintain the shape of the sleeve edges over time.

5. **Branding:** There appears to be branding on the left sleeve, although the specific details cannot be seen in the image. Branding in such locations is standard practice to deliver subtle brand recognition.

6. **Hem:** The t-shirt has a vented hem, which provides more ease of movement around the hips and can make the shirt more comfortable to wear when seated or engaging in activities.

7. **Stitch Detailing:** Stitch detailing on the back neck and shoulder line likely contributes to both the garment's aesthetics and structure, potentially providing reinforcement in areas that experience more movement and stretch.

8. **Embroidery:** There is an appliqu√©d embroidered badge on the left chest, which adds an element of design and branding. Such details are often associated with polo shirts and can range from simple logos to intricate badges.

9. **Fit:** The t-shirt appears to have a regular fit, with the fabric draping naturally and not clinging too tightly to the torso, suggestive of a comfortable garment suitable for everyday use.

10. **Overall Style:** The style of the t-shirt is casual yet can be considered smart-casual because of the collar and button placket. It is suitable for a variety of occasions, from leisure activities to more informal business environments, depending on the dress code.
