Care instructions indicate that the shirt can be machine or hand washed in cold water at 30Â°C with a mild detergent, which is typical for preserving the fabric's integrity and appearance over time. The caution to wash dark colours separately is to prevent colour transfer during washing, which could ruin lighter-coloured fabrics in the same wash cycle. Users are advised not to bleach, which could damage the fabric and colour, to tumble dry low to prevent shrinkage, dry in shade to avoid direct sunlight that could fade the colour, and to use a warm iron to remove wrinkles without damaging the fabric.
