Based on the product details and the available image, we are looking at a white full-sleeve dress shirt designed for formal occasions. Here's a comprehensive analysis:

**Composition & Material:**
The shirt is constructed with a blend of 60% cotton and 40% polyester, which suggests that it aims to provide the comfort and breathability of cotton with the durability and wrinkle-resistance of polyester. The incorporation of dobby weaving with black thread on the front adds a subtle texture and visual interest to the shirt, giving it a unique touch that distinguishes it from plain white shirts.

**Style & Design:**
The shirt features a slim fit, which is typically tailored closer to the body for a more modern, streamlined silhouette. This fit is particularly flattering for those with a slimmer build. The full-length buttoned placket is a classic feature, and the curved hemline allows for the shirt to be worn both tucked and untucked while maintaining a polished look.

**Wash Care:**
The provided wash care instructions indicate that the shirt can be machine or hand washed in cold water at 30Â°C with mild detergent. It's recommended to wash dark colors separately to avoid color bleeding. The shirt should not be bleached, and tumble drying should be at a low setting. It's also advised to dry the shirt in the shade to preserve the fabric quality, with a warm iron used to remove any wrinkles.

**Image Analysis:**
In the provided image, a male model is shown wearing the shirt. The shirt appears crisp and well-fitting on the model, who presumably is wearing the size 40 mentioned in the product details. The model's height and shoulder width are provided to give potential buyers a point of reference regarding fit. From the image, we can observe that the sleeves are a proper length, ending just before the hinge of the wrist, which is ideal for a dress shirt. The collar remains neat without any signs of buckling or gaping, suggesting a sturdy interlining.

**Styling Recommendations:**
The product description suggests pairing the shirt with formal trousers and a pair of leather shoes, which would be appropriate for a professional or formal setting. Given its slim fit and clean, textured aesthetic, this shirt could also pair well with a well-fitted blazer, dress slacks, or even high-quality dark jeans for a semi-formal event.

**Overall Impression:**
This formal white shirt by Indigo Nation presents a mix of classic style with a slightly elevated twist due to the dobby weaving detail. It seems to be designed for those seeking versatile formal wear that maintains an element of interest while still adhering to professional dress codes.
