The product is a black knitted top designed with a comfortable fit in mind. It is made of 100% acrylic, making it lightweight, warm, and relatively easy to care for compared to natural wool. The design features include a front open buttoned placket, which gives the user the flexibility to wear it open or closed depending on the look they desire or the weather conditions. Additionally, it has two pockets on the front, which adds to its functionality, allowing for the carriage of small items or simply for a place to keep hands warm.

The full sleeves are consistent with the overall warm design and are suitable for colder conditions. The top gives off a vintage vibe, suggesting that it is targeting customers who appreciate a classic style with a modern twist.

The wash care instructions are very specific, emphasizing the need to hand wash in cold water with a mild detergent. This is important to maintain the integrity of the acrylic material. The care instructions also advise against the use of bleach, wringing, or tumble drying, instead recommending flat drying in the shade to prevent any distortion or shrinkage, and mild ironing without pressing on any prints, embellishments, or embroidery that might be present on the garment.
