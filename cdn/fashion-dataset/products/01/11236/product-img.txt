The product depicted in the image is a pair of women's skinny jeans in a dark blue wash. Iâ€™ll provide an analysis from a fashion and garment perspective, based on both the details provided and the image:

**Visual Aesthetics and Style:**
- The skinny jeans feature a low-rise waist which sits below the natural waistline, providing a contemporary and youthful look.
- The dark blue wash with fading and whiskering effects adds visual interest and a lived-in feel to the jeans.
- The stitching details are in a contrasting thread color, giving the jeans a classic denim look.
- The jeans are styled with a simple white top and black open-toe heels, which offers a clean and versatile look that can be dressed up or down.

**Material and Fabric Composition:**
- The jeans are composed of 99% cotton and 1% spandex. This combination suggests that the jeans have the breathability and comfort of cotton, with a slight stretch provided by spandex, allowing better movement and fit.

**Fit:**
- As described, the jeans are skinny fit, which means they are likely to be fitted closely to the body from the hip to the hem.
- The model's statistics provided (height, waist, and hip measurements) suggest the jeans are designed to cater to a slender and tall body type.

**Functionality and Pockets:**
- Two insert pockets at the front and two patch pockets on the back are functional and add to the practicality of the jeans.
- Thread detailing on the back pockets adds a decorative element and is commonly found in denim jeans designs.

**Branding:**
- A brand patch appliqued on the waistband at the back offers subtle branding, which is common in denim clothing.

**Closure:**
- Metal zipper and button closure are standard in jeans and provide durability and security.

**Care Instructions:**
- Machine wash in cold water, avoids color fading and is gentle on the fabric.
- The instruction not to tumble dry, and to dry them inside out, away from direct sunlight, helps in maintaining the color and shape of the jeans.
- A warm iron is suitable for smoothing out any creases and suggests that despite the stretch, the spandex content is low enough to tolerate the heat.
- "Do not iron on print" indicates that there may be printed areas or tags on the jeans that could be damaged by high heat.

Overall, the product seems to be a stylish and practical pair of skinny jeans that follow common denim care practices, tailored for a modern, casual look with emphasis on fit and comfort. The image itself portrays the jeans clearly and effectively for potential buyers, with focus on the fit and the wash of the fabric.
