The product depicted in the image is a full-sleeved formal shirt with a pattern that appears to be checks. The color scheme is stated as purple and black, although the checks may not be distinctly visible in the image provided. The material is 100% polyester, which would make the garment lightweight, durable, and relatively wrinkle-resistant, though it may not be as breathable as natural fibers like cotton.

The shirt features a patch pocket on the left chest, which adds a functional element to the garment. It also has a full-length buttoned placket, which is standard for formal shirts, allowing for ease of putting on and taking off the shirt.

According to the product details, the fitting is slim, which would cater to those seeking a more figure-hugging, tailored appearance. Slim-fit shirts can accentuate body shape and are generally considered more modern and fashion-forward.

The washing care instructions suggest the garment is relatively easy to care for, indicating that it can be machine or hand washed in cold water at 30 C with a mild detergent. It's recommended to wash dark colors separately to avoid dye bleeding. Customers are advised to avoid bleach, tumble dry low, dry in shade, and use warm iron, which are standard care instructions to maintain the garment's appearance and prolong its life.
