The product depicted in the image is a full sleeves shirt featuring black and white plaid checks. From the provided details, we know the shirt is made of 100% cotton, which typically offers a soft, breathable quality suitable for different seasons and comfortable wear. The shirt showcases a patch pocket on the left chest, which bears an embroidered brand logo; such details add a touch of brand distinction as well as functionality to the garment.

The shirt also has a full-length buttoned placket, which is standard in most shirts of this style, facilitating easy wearability and a possibility to adjust the neckline for comfort or stylistic preference. The godet inserts on the sides could potentially provide a more tailored fit or some added design detail. The curved hemline suggests that the shirt will fit stylishly over trousers or jeans with a slightly more formal appearance than a straight hem.

An interesting feature of this shirt is the attached grey vest with a graphic print on the front that includes the brand name. The vest gives the illusion of layering without the added bulk and can enhance the outfit's visual appeal. It offers versatility as indicated in the description: it can be worn unbuttoned for a casual, spunky look, or buttoned up for a chic and cool demeanor.

The slim fit of the shirt is in vogue and caters to modern fashion preferences, designed to fit closer to the body for a sharper silhouette.

Regarding wash care, the instructions provided suggest a gentle approach: machine or hand washing in cold water at 30Â°C and using a mild detergent. Customers are advised to wash dark colours separately to prevent dye transfer to lighter clothes. Non-bleaching, tumble drying on low, drying in the shade, and warm ironing are all standard care instructions that aim to maintain the fabric's quality and appearance over time.

The accompanying model is shown wearing a size M in t-shirts, with a height of 6 feet and shoulder width of 18 inches, which should help potential buyers gauge how the item might fit.

Finally, it's briefly suggested that this shirt pairs well with denims or corduroys, offering consumers a tip on how to style the garment to achieve the intended semi-formal look that is neither too formal nor too casual, which is great for settings like a casual Thursday at the office or a relaxed social outing.
