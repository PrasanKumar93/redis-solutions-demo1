The image shows a male model wearing a green and white plaid checked full-sleeves shirt. Consistent with the product description, the shirt appears to be made of 100% cotton fabric, which is known for its breathability and comfort. The overall design includes a full-length buttoned placket with buttons visible down the front, and there is a button mid-sleeve to secure rolled-up cuffsâ€”a detail that can offer versatility in styling and provides a casual look.

The shirt features two chest pockets with flaps, enhancing the utility and style of the garment. Above the right pocket, a brand tab is visible, which is commonly used to add a subtle branding touch without overwhelming the design. On the right shoulder, there is brand embroidery that aligns with the mentioned shoulder panels in fabric, which may contribute to both the aesthetic and the structural integrity of the shirt's design.

The slim fitting described in the product details is suggested by the manner in which the shirt contours to the model's body, offering a tailored appearance that can accentuate the wearer's physique. Given the model's statistics, the shirt showcased is size M, and it fits accordingly on a person with a height of 6 feet and shoulder width of 18 inches.

Regarding wash care, due to the 100% cotton material, the shirt requires gentle handling as per the instructions provided: hand washing in cold water with a mild detergent, without wringing or bleaching, and flat drying in shade to preserve the fabric's quality and color. A warm iron can be used to smooth out creases that may form during washing or wear.

The style recommendations suggest versatility for the shirt, indicating it can be paired with formal pants, denims, or corduroys along with black footwear for different types of looks, from stylish formal to casual.

Overall, the product matches the description given, presenting a casual yet versatile shirt that could be a practical addition to a fashion-conscious individual's wardrobe.
