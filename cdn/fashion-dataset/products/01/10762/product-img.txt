Outsole:
- The TPR (thermoplastic rubber) outsole with textured patterns is meant to provide grip and traction to prevent slipping, an important safety feature for children's footwear.
- The edges of the outsole have a blue color that matches the straps and creates a nice contrast with the yellow footbed.
