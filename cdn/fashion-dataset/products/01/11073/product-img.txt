The pullover appears to be made from an acrylic and wool blend, which suggests that it offers both warmth and durability. The fit of the pullover is described as regular, indicating that it should not be too tight or too loose on a person who orders their typical size.

Examining the design, the sweater has a ribbed neckline and cuffs, which can help maintain the shape of the garment and contribute to the insulation by fitting snugly at the wrists and waist. A metallic appliqu√© is visible on the chest, adding a noticeable embellishment to the otherwise straightforward striped pattern.

The care instructions provided suggest that the pullover requires gentle handling to maintain its condition. It is recommended that the garment be hand washed only in cold water with a mild detergent, and that it should not be bleached, wrung, or tumble dried. To dry it, it should be laid flat in the shade, which can help prevent stretching or distortion. Ironing should be done with care, avoiding any print, embellishment, or embroidery, which is important to preserve any decorative elements.

The styling suggestion includes layering the pullover over a round neck t-shirt or a vest and pairing it with jeans and sports shoes, which creates a casual and comfortable look. The description evokes a cozy winter feel, proposing this outfit for enjoying outdoor activities like eating street food in colder weather.

The model statistics provided indicate that the model is wearing a size 'M' (Medium) and has a height of 6 feet with shoulder measurements of 18 inches, which can be helpful for online shoppers trying to gauge how the pullover might fit them based on the model's physique.

Overall, the product appears to be a practical and stylish choice for winter wear, combining comfort with casual fashion. The care instructions are particularly important for customers to follow to ensure longevity of the pullover.
