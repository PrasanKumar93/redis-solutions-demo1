**Composition:**
- The shirt is made from a blend of 70% polyester and 30% cotton. Polyester is a synthetic fiber known for its durability, resistance to shrinking and stretching, and quick drying properties. Cotton, being a natural fiber, is appreciated for its breathability and softness. The blend aims to provide a mix of durability and comfort.
- There is a visible patch pocket on the left chest, which is a common feature for a semi-formal or formal shirt.

**Fitting:**
- The fitting is described as "Regular," suggesting that it's designed to fit the average body type without being too tight or too loose.
- Based on the model's statistics provided (wears size 40 in shirts, height 6', shoulders 18"), viewers can infer how the shirt might fit their body type in relation to the model shown.

**Wash Care:**
- The care instructions are fairly standard for a blend of polyester and cotton. It involves machine or hand washing in cold water at 30°C with a mild detergent. This helps maintain the fabric's integrity and color.
- The shirt should be washed with dark colors separately to avoid color transfer.
- No bleach should be used, which protects the color and fabric.
- Tumbling dry should be done at low temperatures, and drying should preferably be in the shade to prevent fading and to maintain the fabric's shape.
- A warm iron can be safely used for this fabric blend, keeping the shirt looking crisp.

**Style and Use:**
- The shirt is described as a piece of formal attire, which can be used to inject some interest into a weekday wardrobe. The blue stripes on the white background keep the shirt from looking too plain and offer a more engaging appearance than a solid-color shirt.

- The shirt collar shown is straightforward, with no button-down feature, keeping the look clean and suitable for formal occasions.
