- A toe separator is observed which, along with the thong strap, would help secure the child's foot in place.

- The simplicity of the design suggests easy wearability for children who can quickly slip them on or off without assistance.

### Care Instructions:

- Storing the shoes away from sunlight is recommended to prevent fading or degradation of the materials.

### Branding:
