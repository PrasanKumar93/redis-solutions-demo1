Design:
- The watch has a square dial, which offers a contemporary and sporty look. This shape is less traditional than round dials and can appeal to those who prefer a more modern wristwatch style.
- The case diameter of 30mm is relatively modest, making it suitable for a variety of wrist sizes without being too large or bulky.
- With a case thickness of 12mm, the watch might have a noticeable profile on the wrist, adding to its sporty and rugged appeal.

- The presence of reset buttons on the side suggests easy accessibility for using the various features.
- The quartz movement is a reliable and accurate method for timekeeping, which is standard in many watches.
- An acrylic dial window provides durability and is more shatter-resistant than glass, though it may be more prone to scratches.
- The solid case back made of stainless steel will protect the internal components of the watch and contribute to its overall structural integrity.
