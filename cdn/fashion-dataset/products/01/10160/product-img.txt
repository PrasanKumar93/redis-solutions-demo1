Based on the provided product details and the image, let's conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Puma shoe inspired by the Porsche 917 car as driven by Steve McQueen in the movie "Le Mans":

Design Aesthetics:
- The shoe showcases a sleek and sporty design that echoes the iconic aesthetics of the Porsche 917.
- It features a classic color scheme that appears predominantly white, with black accents, possibly inspired by the racing car's paint job. This combination gives the shoe a timeless look that could appeal to a wide audience.
- The splash of black across the side of the shoe could be an homage to the speed and motion associated with racing cars. This design element gives the shoe a sense of movement and dynamic style.
- The silhouette of the shoe seems low-profile, enhancing its sporty look.

Materials:
- The upper part of the shoe is made of fabric, which likely provides breathability and comfort during wear.
- The durable PU toe box likely adds protection for the wearer's toes and helps maintain the shoe's shape.
- The formstripe on the side of the shoe is not only a signature Puma design element but also mentioned to be made of PU, which adds durability.
- The PU foxing referenced in the description could enhance the shoe's sturdiness, and contributes to its structure and life span.

Midsole:
- An EVA midsole is known for its light weight and cushioning properties. This will offer comfort to the wearer and reduce the impact on their feet during walking or light activity.

Outsole:
- The outsole is made of durable rubber, which is standard for quality footwear due to its wear-resistance and long-lasting nature.
- Ergonomic grooves in the outsole design are intended for providing grip and traction. This design feature is crucial for footwear inspired by a racing theme, as it suggests stability and control similar to that required in performance vehicles.

Branding:
- Although the text does not directly mention branding elements besides the formstripe, the image shows what looks like Puma's logo discreetly placed on the shoe, which users familiar with the brand will be able to identify.

Considering the inspiration behind the shoe, the design and materials selected seem to have been chosen to reflect the elegance, high performance, and style associated with Steve McQueen's 917 car. This shoe could potentially attract customers who are fans of motorsports, or those who appreciate a blend of sporty elegance and comfortable, durable casual footwear.
