The image shows a short-sleeved sports polo shirt with a zipper at the collar. The primary color of the shirt is purple with some white accents on the sleeves and side panels. The shirt features prominent branding, with a large 'NOKIA' logo across the front, suggesting that it's a sponsored or team shirt, possibly for an event or a sports team. There's another logo of what appears to be a sports helmet on the upper left part of the shirt, which could indicate a specific sport or team, and a 'Reebok' logo on the left sleeve, indicating that Reebok is the manufacturer.

The product's wash care instructions detailed in the text outline the following:

- Machine washable in lukewarm water below 40 degrees Celsius with mild detergent to maintain the fabric's quality and color.
- Wash dark colors separately to avoid dye transfer.
- Avoid soaking, bleaching, and tumble drying as these processes can damage the fabric or the print.
- Dry the shirt in shade as direct sunlight can cause the colors to fade.
- Warm ironing is permissible but avoid ironing directly on print, trims, or logos to prevent damage.
- Not suitable for dry cleaning, which suggests that the fabric or printing may not withstand the chemicals used in the dry-cleaning process.

Given these instructions, the shirt is likely made from a synthetic material or a blend that is sensitive to heat and harsh cleaning treatments - common for sports or active wear. The care details stipulate a need to preserve the integrity of the fabric, as well as any printed designs or logos, which are critical to the garment's appearance and branding value.
