The product in the image is a men's navy blue and green narrow striped V-neck full-sleeve pullover. This sweater is composed of a blend of acrylic and wool, integrating the warmth and natural insulation properties of wool with the durability and resistance to wrinkles and shrinkage of acrylic. It presents a regular fit, which is supposed to offer a good balance between a snug fit and ample room for movement, catering to a broad range of body types.

The pullover features ribbing around the V-neck collar, cuffs, and hemline. Ribbing is a common design element in knitwear that adds elasticity and ensures a closer fit where needed. The stripes provide a classic and casual look that can be versatile for various outfits and occasions. 

The presence of the Scullers logo in flock appliquéd on the left chest is a design feature that displays brand identity and adds a subtle textural touch. Flock appliqué is a process where a design or logo is cut from a fuzzy material and applied to the fabric, which gives a raised texture.

In terms of care, the instructions provided suggest that this pullover requires some attention to keep it in good condition. Washing dark colors separately prevents dye transfer to lighter clothing. The recommendation for cold wash with a mild detergent, avoiding wringing and bleaching, aims to preserve the color and fabric quality. Flat drying in shade helps to avoid shrinkage and color fading from the sun.

The style advice suggests pairing this pullover with denim and suede shoes for a casual and stylish winter wear look.
