Based on the product details provided and the image, here is a comprehensive analysis of the product:

**Style and Design:**
The shirt features a white and grey plaid check pattern with black and yellow accents that give it a contemporary look. It is designed with long sleeves and buttoned plackets, which is a classic feature of shirts that allows for adjustable sleeve length and fit. The shirt also features buttoned flaps over the shoulders, a design element that adds visual interest and a military-inspired touch. There are two patch pockets on the chest, providing utility as well as adding to the style quotient. An embroidered brand logo over the left chest pocket lends a branded appeal to the shirt, and the curved hemline offers a finished look that sits well both when the shirt is tucked and untucked.

**Material:**
The shirt is reported to be made of 100% cotton, which is a breathable and comfortable natural fabric suitable for all-day wear. Cotton is generally soft on the skin, making it ideal for casual apparel.

**Fit:**
The fit of the shirt is described as regular, which typically means it is not too snug or too loose. It should be comfortable for a range of body types without being overly baggy or restrictive. The model in the image appears to convey this fit well, with the shirt draping naturally without tightness or excess material.

**Care Instructions:**
The shirt requires machine washing in cold water, which is suitable for preserving the fabric and colors. It is advised not to tumble dry the shirt; instead, it should be turned inside out before drying, avoiding direct sunlight. These precautions help in maintaining the shape and color of the shirt over time. The shirt should be ironed with a warm iron, and care must be taken to not iron on the print to avoid damage.
