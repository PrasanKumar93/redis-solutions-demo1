The bag appears to have a semi-structured shape, with a base that allows it to stand upright when placed on a flat surface, which is indicative of its functionality for everyday use. Here are some key observations about the product:

**Material:** The bag is made of leather, which implies durability and a premium quality. The texture of the leather is pebbled, which suggests it may have an added layer of scratch resistance compared to smooth leather finishes.

**Closure:** There is no visible zipper or clasp from the angle of the image, it might be an open top or have a closure mechanism on the inside, which isn't observable from this view.
